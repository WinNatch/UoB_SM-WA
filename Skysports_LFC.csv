3/17/2025,14:33,Merson calls for perspective after 'bad week' for Liverpool,"Paul Merson says Liverpool have had a bad week but has called for perspective over the Premier League leaders' season. Liverpool are 12 points clear at the top of the table with nine games to go and expected to coast to a record-equalling 20th top-flight English title. But their hopes of a potential treble evaporated in the space of five days with Sunday's Carabao Cup final defeat to Newcastle following hot on the heels of their Champions League exit at the hands of PSG last week. ""That was a tough week for Liverpool. But let's get it in perspective. If someone said at the start of the season that Liverpool would be champions, you wouldn't have believed them, would you? ""When you sit down in the cold light of day, if you're a Liverpool fan or player, the Holy Grail is the Premier League. ""Especially for Liverpool who've won the Champions League enough times, if someone said to you, right, what do you win this season? You'd have to say the Premier League. It's the Holy Grail. ""They won it last time in lockdown. It wasn't the same. Their fans weren't there. And their fans will be there this time when they pick it up. ""So let's not look shy about how great they've done. They've lost one game in the league. They've just had a bad week. ""To lose one game in the Premier League is just mind-blowing.  I think everybody's got to just get it in perspective."""

The  Netherlands centre back's current Reds contract runs out this summer and with still no news on a possible extension, the 33-year-old is set to leave the club on a free this summer. ""I’ve said it many times, at the moment, there’s no news,"" he said after Liverpool's 2-1 loss to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. ""That’s not a good or a bad thing. For me, my full focus and commitment is on the last nine games of the season. ""I’m sure that before the end of the season there’s going to be news.

I must say that's one of the worst performances I've seen from Liverpool in a cup final going back a long time. ""They have given so much this season. They are in a position in the Premier League no one really expected. What this last week has done is shone a light on where Liverpool still need to improve. ""The lack of pace in the team is glaring in the attack. I feel a bit sorry for Mo Salah. He's taken a bit of stick in the last games against PSG, but he doesn't get help off the other attackers. ""The other attackers Liverpool have got are good players not great players. ""Liverpool need to buy two attackers. Not squad players. Players to hopefully play alongside Mo Salah."""
3/16/2025,19:46,Slot: Newcastle stood taller in big moments,"Head coach Arne Slot's verdict on Liverpool's Carabao Cup final loss: ""Newcastle were taller, stronger in the duels, and both goals came from that. We have to be better with the ball, which is not so easy. The moment you do have the ball we have to create more. We were waiting for a moment. ""Normally in a game like this it opens up a bit more, but we gave them the positive mindset of being 1-0 up before the half time. That means they're going to fight even harder for every second ball. ""Altogether Newcastle deserved the win. It wasn't about energy. They played over our press, very smart, a good idea. I keep repeating myself, they deserve this win. ""I don't think anyone who is a Liverpool fan was happy with what they saw but sometimes that happens. It's not the first time we have difficulties with Newcastle."""

It was a game of football as they wanted it to be. That's a compliment to them because we didn't get into our rhythm. They were really aggressive. They defended really well. ""The game went their way. I wouldn't say not brave enough, but they went man for man in a high press and they have players that are very strong, good in the duels. I think Dan Burn won every header, including the goal he scored. ""A deserved win for Newcastle."""

In terms of physicality - set-pieces, duels in the middle of the park, players making overlapping runs, Liverpool couldn't cope physically."""

But Merson also believes being taken to penalties by Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night - then losing the Champions League last 16 tie - will take its toll this weekend. ""The problem with picking themselves up is picking their legs up. Everybody will want to play in a cup final but they had two unbelievable games against PSG - one of them they didn't even touch the ball so that's even harder. ""Then they played the full team for 90 minutes against Southampton [in between the two PSG games]. So I'm not sure tomorrow. ""Harvey Barnes will run at Jarrel Quansah, who will play at right-back wit no Trent Alexander-Arnold or Conor Bradley. The last thing you want as a big centre-half is someone running at you. He will do that for fun. ""It's a big pitch, Wembley. It takes its toll. If we got into extra-time, I'd be shocked if Liverpool started running over Newcastle. I'd be shocked. It's just facts. ""At the start, it will be a leveller. Liverpool will be fresh. But the longer the game goes on and if Newcastle stay in the game, it gives them more and more of a chance of winning. ""If this games goes to extra-time, I'd be shocked if Newcastle were hanging on. Because of the Tuesday factor [Liverpool losing to PSG in the Champions League]. ""And not just the Tuesday factor: they lost. If they had won, I wouldn't be fussed. But when you lose, this would have been the last thing on their agenda."""

Liverpool have a 15-point lead at the top of the Premier League with Slot, in his first season in charge, on the brink of matching Klopp's title triumph in 2020. ""Klopp would grip you like a bear hug after a match and he's living it with you,"" said Wales boss Bellamy, who had two spells as a Liverpool player and won the League Cup there in 2012. ""You could see the affection they (the fans) had for him and I just didn't know if anyone could replace the personality of Klopp. ""Arne Slot is a lot different, of course he has his own influences, but he lives it. ""How do you find that? To be able to do that twice a week - I find that really impressive. ""I feel that's quite important that someone breathes it with you. To have the season he has had has been incredible. ""I have a soft spot for Feyenoord (Slot's former team) as I scored there in the Champions League and I love the De Kuip stadium. It always felt like an amazing stadium. ""So watching Slot with them over the last few seasons was really nice."""

The saga over the Dutchman's future, mirrored by that of Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose deals also run out in June, has been ongoing all season but talks have yet to produce an extension to the 33-year-old's seven-and-a-half-year stay. Van Dijk, for his part, has made no secret of his desire to remain on Merseyside but even with no resolution in sight it has not affected his performances with this campaign arguably one of his best. He is looking to lift his second trophy as captain in their Carabao Cup defence against Newcastle at Wembley and a 15-point lead in the Premier League suggests another title will soon be added to the one he won in 2020. ""Maybe I will run this fully down and then there is still no news, I don't know,"" he said. ""But I don't want to create any anxiety or anything like that, I just keep my head down and focus on hopefully winning the next 10 games. ""I am sure by the end of the season there will be news. But what kind of news I am not sure. ""It's not a one-two-three discussion and there we go. There are multiple factors and as long as I am calm to you guys (the media) then there is no need to panic, whatever may happen in the future. ""If I was worried you would see me playing a little bit worried and that is not the case. ""I am fully committed to Liverpool Football Club at the moment and there is no doubt about that. ""I am so proud to be the captain of this beautiful club that means so much to me and has meant so much to me in the past, as well as my family.""

3/14/2025,13:13,Final not about a response from CL disappointment for Slot,"Sky Sports News' Vinny O'Connor: ""Injuries rather than contract situations are Arne Slot's more pressing concern. While he admitted that, like Virgil Van Dijk, he still doesn't know who of the three out-of-contract players will be staying or going in the summer, it appears he doesn't need to know at this point. ""What he does know is that he won't have Trent Alexander-Arnold available for the League Cup Final with the injury he sustained in the Champions League last 16 exit to PSG, and without putting a timescale on his recovery, the Liverpool head coach is hopeful he will have him back before the end of the season, with the Reds closing in on their 20th league title. ""However, it leaves him with an interesting decision at right back. Jarell Quansah has performed well there when needed, a need that's been heightened with Joe Gomez and Conor Bradley still sidelined. ""Wataru Endo is another option, he too has played there before, while there is also the possibility of switching one of Andy Robertson or Kostas Tsimikas from left back. Slot also hinted that Curtis Jones filling in there is something else he could consider ahead of the squad's first full training session following Tuesday night's disappointment. ""Wednesday was a recovery day after as intense an experience as Liverpool have faced this season, while Thursday was much-needed time off. ""Preparations now ramp up again ahead of the first opportunity for Slot to deliver his first trophy as Liverpool's Head Coach. ""He's looking at the weekend in isolation. It's not about a response to their Champions League exit as the disappointment of going out will still be felt...but you play games like this to win and that's the sole aim heading to a final...an experience he will never take for granted."""

""Both teams have two, or three or four players who cannot play. That's almost a privilege because so many teams have had more than that. ""Two or three injuries is the minimum you can expect after months of non-stop football. It's a big compliment to staff of Newcastle and Liverpool that players are available.

3/14/2025,10:37,Slot on Nunez's reaction to PSG penalty miss,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot on whether he has had to pick Darwin Nunez up after he missed his penalty in the defeat to PSG: ""I assume Curtis [Jones] felt the same. I think every player who takes a penalty and misses doesn't feel well, but it's not only the two that missed, it's all the others who didn't feel positive because we lost. ""They took the responsibility. You can miss a chance or a penalty but that is what happens if you take the responsibility of taking a penalty. ""We were closer to winning the game in the 90 minutes.

Last season everyone saw what a talent he is. Then, this season started with him starting, but I changed him against Ipswich and Ibou and Virgil were - and are - such a strong combination that he didn't play a lot. ""Afterwards, every time he played, everyone could see that he is no longer just a [young] talent because as a [young] talent you don't have any setbacks. ""The moment you get setbacks, it's about how you react and I think he showed in his recent performances that he outgrew being called a [young] talent and that is probably what Thomas Tuchel saw and sees by calling him up. ""He did really well the last few times he had to play for us, even in a position he is not used to, as a right-back, but he has the qualities to play there. He's strong, he's fast, he's very comfortable on the ball, and it gives us an extra quality in terms of set-pieces. ""He showed mentality, and that he had quality, which we knew when we saw him playing last season."""
3/14/2025,10:24,Slot: Tiredness not an issue for Newcastle showdown,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot: ""I think it's quite normal that players are tired in extra time, especially if the 90 minutes were so intense and you don't get a reward for that. ""I made five changes, so five out of the 10 [outfield] players on the pitch could never be tired. So I don't think that was the reason why Paris Saint-Germain were better in the last half an hour. In my opinion, that had nothing to do with us being tired. ""There are four days in between. The players are able to play on Sunday again, definitely."""

""Our league position is another reason to keep on going. If you have to exit a tournament, I prefer to go out in the manner we did against Paris Saint-Germain and against Plymouth. ""I couldn't have asked for more from the players. We started the game and forced them into so many mistakes and created chances we normally score. ""I also liked the game because it was pure football. I have seen so may games recently and in my life where it's all about time-delaying and dives and pretending to be injured.

Van Dijk said on Prime Video: “It was very intense, a great game of football to be part of. “Obviously it was a totally different Liverpool from what we showed in Paris but, unfortunately, went out on penalties and that’s the reality. “I said to the guys you can be disappointed because we are out of the competition, chin up and get ready for the next challenge. It’s a beautiful one on the weekend, so we go again.”"
3/11/2025,21:50,Alexander-Arnold and Konate doubts for Carabao Cup final,"DefendersTrent Alexander-ArnoldandIbrahima Konateare potential doubts for the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle on Sunday after coming off with injuries duringLiverpool's Champions League clash with PSG. England international Alexander-Arnold was substituted in the 73rd minute at Anfield after landing awkwardly on his right ankle. It looked bad as Alexander-Arnold was clearly in pain After the game, Liverpool boss Arne Slot admitted Alexander-Arnold is a doubt for Sunday's final. ""I wouldn't be surprised if he isn't available on Sunday,"" Slot said at full-time. Sky Sports Newsreporter Vinny O'Connor was at Anfield and here is how he described Alexander-Arnold's injury in our match blog. ""Alexander-Arnold's studs seemed to get caught in the turf as he went in for the tackle,"" he said. ""He's  getting a standing ovation from the main stand as he limps straight to the tunnel. ""Looking at him you have to say he's a doubt for the League Cup final....I really hope lightning hasn't struck twice after he missed last season's victory at Wembley over Chelsea."" The injury means Alexander-Arnold could also be a doubt for Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad, due to be announced later this week. Meanwhile, Konate was forced from the field in extra-time, limping off to be replaced by Wataru Endo. O'Connor added: ""Another injury concern for Liverpool as Konate limps off with Endo replacing him. ""It again shows how difficult it is to win multiple trophies. On such a big night in a massive Champions League last-16 tie, Liverpool have now lost two players through injury and what remains to be seen is the implication that has for the League Cup final at the weekend.""

I don't support either team, but the excitement. From the first leg, I haven't seen any team do that to Liverpool - they destroyed them. ""PSG will be thinking 'we couldn't have played any better and we've lost 1-0' - that's soul destroying. When we talk about atmospheres, we're talking about Celtic Park and Anfield for big European nights, the fans are going to be up for this. ""It's hard to call. Liverpool were atrocious first half against Southampton last weekend and they cannot afford to play like that for 45 minutes against PSG. I would have to go for Liverpool because of home advantage, but I still think there's goals in it for PSG. This could go all the way this game. ""Liverpool going to Villa in the next round is a hard draw. It's a difficult game, it's not the kindest of draws. This is the harder half of the draw - whoever gets through it deserves to win the competition. ""Liverpool have to go full pelt week in, week out. You can't turn it on and off like a tap. That might be their problem, but they can wrap this Premier League up quickly. The league is won."""

PSG trail 1-0 from their first leg despite a dominant display at the Parc des Princes but the former Barcelona boss is confident they can turn things around on Tuesday. “The most important game is the one which comes next and I hope it (the most important game) will be the last one of the season,” he said. “Even though we’re trailing from the first leg we will be playing our own game from the outset. Regardless of the result (in Paris) we wouldn’t do anything different. “At the moment we are out so our only option is to go out and win and that is what is driving us. “I don’t think Arne Slot has much doubts about our starting XI, I’ve got my ideas about his starting XI as well. “I’m not going to give away who we are going to play or how we are going to play but over the course of two games we will see two of the best teams in Europe, two contenders for the final and whoever goes through will go through to the final.”"

The Portuguese's five career goals in the Champions League include a 2020 hat-trick against Atalanta so he has some improvement to do on that front. Jota, who has been plagued by injuries over the last few seasons, has only scored eight goals this season, with the last coming two months ago at Nottingham Forest. “It’s been a difficult season for me personally, I had a few complications throughout the season,” he said ahead of the Champions League last 16 second-leg tie at home to Paris Saint-Germain. “These last couple of months matter the most when they decide things and I don’t feel I am at my best form at the moment but certainly by playing I will get there. “Stats are a part of today’s game but they don’t say everything. I want to score, obviously, but that is not a factor which will impact my game tomorrow. “If I don’t score but we go through I don’t mind a few more days into it (his Champions League drought). “As long as you keep being useful to the team that is the most important. Sometimes it is not only the stats but the way you can connect with your team-mates and help defensively and in the end help the team get the win. “That’s what I try to do every time I’m on the pitch.”"

Carragher claimed Arne Slot's side are ""miles ahead"" of the likes of Man City and Arsenal due to Slot taking the team to ""another level"" since succeeding Jurgen Klopp in the summer. ""There's a narrative in the last few weeks that this Liverpool team aren't that good and maybe the league isn't that good,"" Carragher said. ""There's no doubt Man City have dropped off and this Liverpool team isn't as good as the Liverpool teams who won the league under [Jurgen] Klopp and went really close with City the first time around. ""But last season Liverpool were buidling again under Klopp and Arne Slot has taken it on another level again. When you're looking at the underlying numbers, they're miles ahead of everybody else. ""They're miles ahead points-wise. Goal scoring, they're miles ahead. I'm not quite sure what else they could do. ""Liverpool haven't even signed a player from last season. They bought a squad player who has played about half an hour in the Premier League, Chiesa. This is basically last season's team. Slot has added his touch to it. ""It's been a fantastic campaign from Liverpool and they probably do deserve a little bit more credit than they're getting right now."""

The Reds sit 15 points clear of Arsenal in second with a Carabao Cup final against Newcastle and second-leg tie vs PSG in the Champions League on the horizon. ""I think Klopp gets a lot of credit for restructuring that team and the midfield,"" Carragher said. ""That was a team that came really close last season. The reason it didn't go any further was because they had a lot of injuries. ""At this stage last season Liverpool were going into a Carabao Cup final against Chelsea with 11 or 12 first-team players out and they still win a cup. Even though you get injuries at times, you still have to deal with it."" On Slot's role in the impressive campaign, Carragher added: ""Klopp deserves great credit - but I'd never take anything away from the manager who is the manager who wins the league. ""Slot came in, everyone expected them to drop off, people thought they'd be in a fight for Champions League positions. It's not Slot's fault Man City have had a massive drop-off. ""He's still going to get a points total that would have been really competitive with Man City in any season they've been winning Premier League titles. ""He's done a miraculous job and I would say in his first season, if he could come out of the season with two trophies [the Premier League and a cup], it's arguably as good as any first season we've seen by a manager in the Premier League bar Claudio Ranieri at Leicester which is the biggest story we've ever seen."""

Luis Enrique's side arrive on Merseyside knowing they have to score to stand a chance of progressing and Van Dijk believes that could make them even more dangerous. ""I think they are an outstanding team, a fantastic team, you can see the work rate they put in,"" he said. ""We obviously had a debrief after the game about it and you could see them, if they lost the ball, pressing all of them together and running all together. ""It's a big credit to the manager to put that work in and he made, in my eyes, a world-class team out of it. ""It will be tough on Tuesday and you will all see. I think anyone who before our game over there expected it to be a dominating performance from us I don't think they really looked at PSG throughout the season. ""We were prepared very well, obviously we could have done better in some ways, but we know that on Tuesday it is going to be as tough, maybe even tougher, because they will have to come and win."""

3/9/2025,12:14,Robertson hails 'gung ho' approach in Saints game,"DefenderAndy Robertsonfelt a return toLiverpool'sformer ""gung ho"" style was key in changing the game for thePremier Leagueleaders againstSouthampton. However, he accepts there will have to be wholesale improvements for Tuesday's second leg against Paris Saint-Germain if they want to make the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The hangover from the backs-to-the-wall 1-0 win in Parc des Princes were felt in the first half as Saints' Will Smallbone capitalised on the lethargy and a misunderstanding between Virgil van Dijk and goalkeeper Alisson Becker to put the visitors ahead. A half-time blast from head coach Arne Slot and a triple substitution saw Liverpool emerge a different side and two goals inside five minutes from Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah (with a penalty) turned things around before the Egypt international added a second late spot-kick to secure a 3-1 victory. Slot's style since replacing Jurgen Klopp has been much more controlled but certainly for the early exchanges after the interval some of the old chaos was back. ""The first 10 to 15 minutes of the second half I thought we blew them away and that was maybe similar to what we have kind of done in previous seasons,"" said Robertson, one of the three players to come off the bench and make an immediate impact. ""Maybe we have a bit more control and have time to be a bit more patient, whereas the 2019-20 (Premier League-winning) team when we got the ball we killed people on the counter-attack. ""It is different (now) but I do still think we have elements and you saw that in the second half where we were very gung-ho and just put Southampton under pressure and kept them penned in. ""Thankfully the lads had their shooting boots on and we were able to punish them."""
3/8/2025,20:05,Slot: I had to create anger,"Arne Slot admittedLiverpool's first-half performance against Southampton was a ""warning sign"" as he had to ""create anger"" in the dressing room at the break. Slot told Sky Sports: ""It was a very poor performance in the first half. Maybe if you see the highlights you would feel there were three or four chances, but we were not in the game at all and it didn't come to a surprise to me that we conceded a goal. Especially if you look at the way we conceded it, it tells you all about our first half. ""We found a way to win the game in the second half. ""In the media, in my meetings, I made clear to them how difficult of a game this was and that we have to play on different intensity levels than we've played against Paris Saint-Germain. Maybe also to get used to that level of intensity that we're going to experience Tuesday again. But in the end I had to make some hard decisions, maybe at half-time, to create a certain anger with the players. ""That triple substitution at the start of the second half seemed to reignite the team. The three that came in did really well. That's the first thing, but I could see from the other eight a different attitude as well. ""So if you look at the first goal, we played the ball to Diaz and all of a sudden he was on tempo trying to create something, where in the first half he kept the ball waiting, waiting, waiting and that was not only for him, but in general. ""And in the second goal you could see Ryan Gravenberch pushing up, winning the second ball which led to the penalty, where in the first half they could every time escape after we crossed the ball. ""I'm fully aware of the fact that if you play a season, you cannot play 38 times in the highest intensity or the best possible football you can play. So sometimes you have to find another way of winning a game. ""But the first half today is hopefully a warning sign because like I said, we've experienced it already in Paris, that the intensity, the way they play, was very high for us on that night. And if I compare it with the intensity we played today, it's not one, two, three, four, five steps, it's probably six or seven or eight steps down towards the intensity levels of Paris Saint-Germain.""

3/8/2025,20:00,Slot: Why I kept Nunez on,"Arne Slotexplained he keptDarwin Nunezon the field againstSouthampton- despite his discipline causing concern - because of his goal-scoring ability. Slot was rewarded for his faith when Nunez helped to turn the game at home to Saints, scoring the equaliser and winning a penalty that was converted by Mohamed Salah asLiverpoolearned a 3-1 win. But Nunez was perhaps fortunate to still be on the pitch after a desperate kick atKyle Walker-Peters, with VAR deciding not to recommend upgrading the incident from a yellow card to a red. ""In the end I took him off because he was on a yellow, but I always hate the idea, if we need to score goals, to take someone off that can score a goal,"" said Slot. ""That's why it wasn't in my mind to take him off because I was already planning on after these three, if we don't score a goal, then [Diogo] Jota needs to come in and we have to go even more offensive. ""With Cody [Gakpo] being out it isn't like we have that many attacking options left, so that's why I took a certain risk of keeping him on."""

The 21-year-old came off the bench in the 86th minute to score with his first touch as an utterly dominantParis Saint-Germainwere stunned in the Parc des Princes. It was only his 18th appearance of the season and of his four starts only one has been in Europe and none in the Premier League. Elliott's ability to play in midfield and up front - he replaced Mohamed Salah after a terrible night - has not offered any advantage as competition is fierce in both departments with Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szobozslai virtually picking themselves and Salah a guaranteed starter. But his youth is something which is regularly overlooked, even by the player himself, as he has been at the club since 2019 and is approaching 150 appearances. ""I'm still young, it's a hard thing to understand in my head really,"" he said. ""I've played nearly 150 games for Liverpool and I feel like I'm very experienced in terms of that aspect.

The loanee has not featured for Boro since their 2-1 defeat to Preston on January 25. Carrick confirmed that the injury was not a new one after it was reported that Doak was close to a return last week. Sky Sports Newsunderstands Doak suffered a muscle injury in his thigh. Middlesbrough have 11 games remaining in their play-off push, and Doak could now miss Scotland’s Nations League double header against Greece on March 20 and 23. “He’s back at Liverpool doing a bit of rehab now which, when it gets to that stage, it can be quite normal for that to happen. We’ve had it before with players,” Carrick said. “We’ll see how that goes and how long he is going to be out for but at the moment we’ll have to wait and see. “It’s just quite recently to be honest, he was doing his rehab and then it came about. It is unfortunate for all of us really, certainly for us as a squad, for Ben personally and individually to suffer that but it is part of the game and he’ll be back stronger and be back soon enough.” Asked if Doak had played his last game this season, Carrick added: “We’ll have to wait and see, it’s hard to say either way at this stage."""
3/6/2025,15:31,Van Dijk says Reds must be ready to suffer in Champions League return,"Virgil van Dijkhas warnedLiverpool’s Champions League suffering is not yet over after coming through a gruelling examination againstParis Saint-Germainin the Parc des Princes. Having been totally dominated for 87 minutes, substitute Harvey Elliott scored with his first touch – and his team’s first shot on target – to snatch a barely-believable 1-0 victory in their Champions League last-16 first leg. PSG were so dominant – they outshot their opponents 27 to two and had more than 70 per cent possession – Liverpool looked a different team from the one which has opened up a 13-point lead in the Premier League having won their first seven European matches and conceding just one goal. It was torturous viewing for fans inside the stadium and watching on television and was not that much fun for the players either who, particularly in the first half, looked a shadow of their best selves. Although Elliott’s goal changed the complexion of the tie, next week’s return at Anfield has the potential to be equally fraught against a team who saw their 10-match winning run – in which they scored 40 times – and unbeaten sequence stretching back to November ended. “It should be a great game and we have to be ready to suffer as they are a very good team who were unbeaten for a very long time,” said Van Dijk. “A team that has blown sides away this season and we have managed to keep a clean sheet (PSG failed to score at home for the first time this season), get a 1-0 win and put ourselves in a good position. “I think you could see, it was not the usual game we like to play. “We don’t want to be playing this way because everyone who plays football wants to have the ball a lot and wants to be dominating opponents. “But we played against a team with a lot of quality, world-class quality, and they made it very difficult for everyone in the world so far and they made it difficult for us but we found a way and we have to try to finish it off next week.”"
3/5/2025,23:35,Slot: We would have been lucky to get a draw!,"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot was honest enough to admit that a draw would have flattered his side in Paris let alone the 1-0 win that they snatched courtesy of Harvey Elliott's late goal. “Had we got a draw, we would still have been the lucky ones. They were much the better team today. In the first half, they had many chances. In the second half, they were still the better team. “In the first half they had three or four open chances, one-on-ones, a cut back that just went over the bar. And the moment that Dembele went one-on-one and the ball came back and two or three chances in a row, so in the first half it was almost a miracle that it was 0-0."" Slot added: ""It’s a good result for us, but we felt the quality of Paris. Every underlying stat shows you they were the best side in the Champions League. ""I wasn’t surprised at how good they were. We were not under-par, it was just down to the quality of the opposition. They showed it today. Luis Enrique has created an incredible team here.”"
3/5/2025,23:09,Elliott for Salah switch pays off,"What a moment for Harvey Elliott. Nuno Mendes had been handed the most difficult task in football in shutting down Mohamed Salah but he did it superbly. Job done? Not quite. Mendes’ failure to track Elliott’s run was ruthlessly punished by the substitute. Perhaps the PSG left-back had assumed that Elliott had been brought on as a negative tactic, to see the game out with a more defensive mindset than Salah. Instead, when Darwin Nunez succeeded in holding the ball up, Elliott sprang forward at pace. Mendes knew. His hands went to his head in sheer frustration as the ball crept past Gianluigi Donnarumma into the far corner. It was a reminder that while there are superstars in this Liverpool team, no defender can sleep on their substitutes either."
3/5/2025,22:52,Every shot Alisson faced...,"Alisson was outstanding this evening, but Arne Slot made the point that the majority of the chances in the second half came from outside Liverpool’s penalty box. That is why the expected-goals total for Paris Saint-Germain was ‘only’ 1.82 in the game. Some of those attempts – notably from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Desire Doue – were right in the corner and a lesser goalkeeper would not have got near them but some credit is due to Liverpool’s defenders too because they stopped PSG getting closer."
3/5/2025,22:32,Elliott: My goal was a chance to repay Alisson,"LiverpoolheroHarvey Elliotthas said his matchwinning goal againstParis Saint-Germainwas an opportunity to ""repay"" goalkeeperAlissonfollowing his heroics in the Champions League.

""Add to that the sentiment that Liverpool ended up with the toughest draw they could receive, despite all they achieved in topping the league standings, then the Liverpool head coach is not getting ahead of himself. ""Impressed by the job Enrique is doing, highlighting the return to his best form (if not the best ever form) of Ousmane Dembele, Slot recognises Liverpool may have to suffer at times across the two legs with the way that PSG press and look to dominate the ball. ""That may see Liverpool having to be more like they were against Manchester City. ""PSG on the other hand, have the problem of stopping Mo Salah and his fellow ‘fighter jets’ up front as Luis Enrique called them. ""Slot acknowledges that Enrique is right to say PSG are definitely one of the best teams when they have the ball - so, thoughts of emulating Joe Fagan’s first season in charge by delivering a treble are far away - the focus remains on the next game.

Liverpool sit 13 points clear at the top of the Premier League and also finished at the summit of the competition's league phase. Asked about Enrique's comments during his press conference on Tuesday, Slot was grateful for the generous acclaim but suggested his side must win the Champions League to be the best. ""It's a nice compliment to get but the best team in Europe has to win the Champions League,"" Slot said. ""We are far away from that and it starts with a very difficult game tomorrow, and then all the difficult ones that are coming up because we already know the draw. ""I think the best team in Europe at the moment is stillReal Madridbecause they won this competition last season. For us to say that, you first have to win it."" Slot also returned the compliment, suggesting Enrique's PSG, who were semi-finalists last season, are a better side than they were last campaign. ""It's clear that Luis Enrique did a great job over here in the past one-and-a-half seasons and he was already in the semi-final of the Champions League last season. In my opinion, this team is even better than the one that he managed last season.

A surprising 15th place in the new-format group phase league table saw them face a play-off against fellow Ligue 1 side Brest, which they coasted through, but that lowly finish means they must now face a Liverpool side which has lost just three times all season in three different competitions. However, they will go into the game with some confidence as at the Parc des Princes this season they have won 14 of their 18 matches, only losing to Atletico Madrid in early November, and have scored in every home game this season. But they have lost nine of the last 30 European matches in the capital and their record against English teams is just three wins in nine at home and five from 18 home and away. “It will be intense. On paper, it is one of the best matches you can watch in Europe. They’re one of the best teams in terms of counter-attacking,” added Luis Enrique. “We have to be careful that we don’t suffer from their transitions. They have three fighter jets in attack, it’s not easy to stop them if we don’t impose our game on them. “We will need the ball. Maybe we’re not as tough physically but we are one of the best teams in possession in Europe. “The first game will not determine who gets through. If we were to lose at home and then win (and qualify) at Anfield, of course I would take that.”"

Graham, who left Liverpool in 2023 after more than a decade at the club, told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit: ""I helped with the work for the last contract extension which sees him through to this summer. “And at the time, I went into that thinking, with players of this age, I'm going to be recommending to not extend his contract and I was surprised by the results of my analysis. The strength of data forces you to take an objective viewpoint and you can surprise yourself. ""Looking at his calibre of player I was surprised how consistently they went into their early 30s still performing at the same level and when those players drop off, it tends to be a drop in minutes rather than a drop in quality. It's a question of physical fitness rather than their skills falling away. ""So, in summer 2022, even though I was surprised it was [based on the data] we should consider giving Salah a chunky new contract.

""In general, if you want to win the ball Ballon d'Or you need to win something. He takes this challenge by scoring a big goal [against Man City], but he wants the team to win with his outstanding defensive work rate. If we can win something he'll have a far bigger chance to win an individual prize. ""It would make his chance bigger [if we won the Champions League]. It is not only about the amount of games you win, all the winners in the past won either the league or Champions League. You need the team to be able to win an individual prize. That's what Mo understands really well. His work rate is so helpful for us. In Salah's time with Liverpool only he, Haaland and ex-Spurs striker Harry Kane have reached 25 or more goals in a Premier League season. ""It's so difficult to compare Mo to other players,"" Slot added. ""The comparison [between him and Lionel Messi] is more difficult because Messi didn't play in the Premier League. ""Mo has had some outstanding seasons and I hope we see him here for many more. He of course needs to extend his contract first. You can say the better he does the more expensive he becomes. But for everyone [at Liverpool] it's the best that he brings the performances, to play at this club you need to bring his level. We only need players at the top of their game - this is one of the best clubs in the world to play for. ""What I see is a top professional. He works so hard on his body. I even think he works at home. He's found the balance for himself, to get the best out of himself. He's played so many games at the highest level."""
2/25/2025,08:01,Liverpool can't take eye off the ball against Newcastle,"Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: Despite his side being 11 points clear of Arsenal at the top of the Premier League after Sunday's impressive 2-0 win at Man City and seemingly closing in on the Premier League title, Liverpool manager Arne Slot is refusing to look beyond Wednesday's visit of Newcastle United, who they also face in March's Carabao Cup final, to Anfield. The Reds produced an equally comprehensive display to see off the champions back at the start of December, only to then be brought down to earth by a thrilling 3-3 draw at St James' Park a few days later in a clash in which the Premier League's top two scorers, Mo Salah and Alexander Isak, netted. That is why Slot has warned his players not to take their collective eye off the ball when they host a fifth-placed Magpies side with Champions League football next season now in sight after victory over Nottingham Forest on Sunday saw them close to within just three points of their opponents in third. ""Now we play against Newcastle and we played a 3-3 over there which was, in my opinion, also a good result, although after 89 minutes we were 3-2 up, but we also experienced how difficult that one is,"" said the Dutchman after his team's win at the Etihad, ""In every other league, I think a lead like this would be very comfortable - except for this one because in this league every single game gives you a lot of challenges.""

2/24/2025,18:08,Salah is Premier League's best-ever player,"Sky Sports' Paul Merson: ""Mohamed Salah is just extraordinary at what he does. He's not always involved in the game but he is on a different planet at the moment. He is absolutely phenomenal. ""I think that's been the difference most of the time. When he's turned up, and he's turned up nearly every game, he doesn't have to be playing unbelievably well to do something unbelievably well. ""Some people are better footballers than players. There'd be some who's a better player, but they're not a better footballer. Dennis Bergkamp is an unbelievable footballer. He didn't put up the figures that Salah's put up. ""Salah's a much, much better player than him. But I wouldn't say he's a much, much better footballer than him. ""Salah is the best player the Premier League has ever seen as he changes games on a consistent basis. No one has done that like him. ""But Thierry Henry is the only player I've ever seen playing in the Premier League who looks like a 20-year-old playing in an U12s league. I don't get that with Salah but if Liverpool win the Champions League he will win the Ballon d'Or."

2/24/2025,12:05,Van Dijk: Too early to talk title,"LiverpoolcaptainVirgil van Dijkrecognises the huge significance of Sunday's win atManchester City- but is not joining fans chanting about a title win yet. The Premier League leaders took a huge stride towards claiming the crown as they capitalised onArsenal'sdefeat byWest Hamon Saturday with a confident 2-0 victory at the Etihad Stadium. The triumph, sealed with goals from the irrepressibleMohamed SalahandDominik Szoboszlai, lifted the Reds 11 points clear at the top of the table with 11 games to play. After nervy performances againstEverton,WolvesandAston Villa, it was a strong statement win against the champions from the past four years. The Gunners do still have a game in hand but Reds supporters chanting ""we're going to win the league"" underlined their confidence after what felt like a decisive weekend. Van Dijk said: ""It was a big win but I think a couple of days ago there was noise about other things, and it could go the other way. ""Obviously, the result on Saturday and the result of this gives them (the fans) the belief. ""But it's down to us to just keep focusing on the game ahead of us. That's what we do and that's what I've told the boys as well. ""It's all about recovery now and being ready for Newcastle, which is a big test as well."""

2/23/2025,20:57,Neville's Salah verdict in full: 'That is what world-class looks like',"Gary Neville, speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast about Mohamed Salah: ""He's been class for however long he's been at Liverpool, but when I watch him at the moment, he's unplayable, and psychologically he's in the head of the opponent that he's up against. ""When you play against someone that, you think, 'Well, I'm gonna smash him, I'm gonna knock him, I'm gonna go through him.' You can't, he's like a brick wall. ""That ball gets played up to him from 40 to 50 yards away from Alisson into his chest [for the second goal], and he's holding Gvardiol off, who's 6ft 3in, like he's a little boy. He's been doing that all season, and I've not maybe seen that in the past from him. ""Everything's so polished and so perfect and so slow, and when I say slow, I mean that being in the final third is the most frantic place on a football pitch, but everything just feels so composed and slow-motion when he's on the ball. ""You know he's going to play the pass at the right moment, you know it's going to be the right weight of pass, you know he's going to play the right cross, you know he's going to be efficient in his shooting. ""He's absolutely at the top of his game, he's a different level than anything else in the league this season in terms of his performance levels, and he's world-class. ""I'm not going bring up his contract, but Liverpool obviously will be desperate to try and keep him, but he's one of the very best players that the Premier League has seen. ""When I used to look back on my career, particularly in my first title season, when [Eric] Cantona scored single goals, and you just thought, 'That's the difference, the difference player, the player who just delivers at the most challenging moment at the crux of the season where the title's on the line, where you're playing against the best teams.' ""Who's going to stand up and win you the match? That's what Salah is for Liverpool. Today, the goal he scores, the assist for the second, honestly, that is what you want from world-class players. ""That is what world-class looks like. They turn up in the biggest moments, and he's done that here at City today."""
2/23/2025,20:55,Nev: Liverpool will feel unbeatable after title-defining win,"Sky Sports' Gary Neville assessing Liverpool's chances of winning the Premier League: ""They haven't won it obviously, but they have, yeah. “I think in years gone by I’ve got involved in debates with other people around, that Arsenal didn't need to come here and win. You do. You do have to come here and win, and I think I always felt that, maybe it didn't always happen when I played. ""But to really make a statement when you're trying to take a title off someone, when you're trying to really ram it home that you are worthy title winners, you need to go and do something different. ""Liverpool are not just going 11 points clear, which puts them in an incredible position, but psychologically you feel unbeatable after a game like today."" “Those Liverpool players in that dressing room, there'll be such a warmth, such a feeling of togetherness and spirit, not just the togetherness out on the pitch that we saw, but the spirit when they get into that dressing room now will be electric, they'll feel it. “I'm sure there'll be some sort of sensible voices, the coaches, the manager, [Virgil] Van Dijk, maybe [Mohamed] Salah, with ‘The job's not done, the job's not done’, you constantly have to tell yourself that and guard against complacency."""
2/23/2025,20:49,Analysis: Liverpool's title to lose,"Sky Sports' Laura Hunter: The visiting Liverpool fans chanted about winning the league throughout the game. When victory was sealed they stayed behind to bellow out ""we shall not be moved"". After such a compelling win over a once-formidable opponent, that statement is as close as it has ever been to reality. Liverpool are unlikely to be dislodged from such a position of power. They barely look like blinking. Nervy performances against Everton, Wolves and Aston Villa had raised questions over how Arne Slot's would cope with the pressure of the run-in but they responded emphatically against City. Jurgen Klopp did the double over Pep Guardiola in his first season in charge, but never since. Slot has also done it at the first time of asking. ""In every other league a lead like this would be very comfortable but not in this one,"" the Dutchman warned post-match. He fails to accept the label of 'champions in wait' so early in the season. A wise approach. But as of now, this is surely Liverpool's title to lose."
2/23/2025,20:45,Slot: Nothing certain in Premier League,"Liverpool head coachArne Slotrefused to consider the prospect the Premier League title was theirs to lose after a 2-0 victory over Manchester City sent his side 11 points clear the top. First-half goals from Mohamed Salah, his 30th of the season, and Dominik Szoboszlai were followed by a disciplined defensive performance after the break to secure a first league victory at the Etihad Stadium since November 2015. Although second-placed Arsenal have a match in hand, Slot's team would have to lose three times - they have suffered one league defeat all season - in their last 11 matches to even offer the chance of being overtaken, and then only if Mikel Arteta's side were able to win every game. But Slot is refusing to look beyond Wednesday's visit of Newcastle despite joyous fans singing about winning the league at the final whistle. ""The fans can sing whatever they want, but we know as a team how hard we have to work for every single win,"" he said. ""It is only three days ago someone asked me if we had a dip on Wednesday (in a 2-2 draw with Aston Villa). I don't believe that as well as I'm calm now about this win. ""You can ask every single question you want, but it is so hard to judge the league table before every single game is played. ""In my opinion, Villa and City away (Liverpool's last two matches) are two very difficult games so you can drop points there. ""In every other league having a lead like this would be very comfortable - except for this one because this league every single game gives you a lot of challenges."""
2/23/2025,19:27,Salah says ‘special’ season is his favourite as a Liverpool player,"Mohamed Salahsays his current record-breaking season is his favourite as theLiverpoolforward continues to set new landmarks almost every week. A man-of-the-match performance in the 2-0 win at Manchester City, which extended the club’s lead at the top of the table to 11 points, saw him become the first player in Premier League history to score and assist in both games against the reigning champions in the same season. He has now scored and assisted in 11 Premier League matches this season, the most by a player in a single season in one of Europe’s big five leagues since Lionel Messi for Barcelona in 2014-15 (11). In scoring the opener he took his tally to 30 for the campaign, 25 of which have been in the league, and moved level with Gordon Hodgson in joint-third in the club’s all-time goalscorers list with 241. Asked if he was playing better than ever, Salah told Sky Sports: “I don’t know. It is opinion. “Maybe people prefer my first seasons or now but I prefer now because winning the league, helping the young players, it is special.” The Egypt international is entering the final four months of his contract with no sign yet that an extension will be agreed. But that has not impinged on the 32-year-old’s form as the quest for a second Premier League title, plus having a Carabao Cup final to contest and a last-16 tie against Paris St-Germain next month, is driving him on to greater heights. “We need another title. Me and the big guys in the team, we need another title,” he added of the desire of the likes of him and fellow senior players Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson and Alisson Becker to double their tally of Premier League winners’ medals. Salah has become the first player in Premier League history to register 40-plus goal involvements in two different seasons and the first in Europe’s top five leagues to be directly involved in 50 goals across all competitions this season."

So it tells you how disappointed I was to see him miss so much. It tells you how much of a miss it has been not to have him. ""I would love to play him 90 mins every game, but he has been out and returning and then injured again, so I hope people understand why we are so cautious with him. ""We have to keep him available for 12 Premier League games, Champions League and League Cup final, not an easy balance to find. I would have loved to keep him in the team as he was playing so well, as well as Trent. ""Mark Lawrenson couldn't understand why I took Trent off! I hope now he does. We spoke about this a week that five games, Trent already knows his minutes, that was when Conor was available, so maybe we adjust our plan now.

That for me is a more important message because that's the life of a striker. He will have probably missed a few chances in his career and he probably would've scored a few as well.

""But he is not there yet, which is completely normal. It also depends on the playing style of style of the opponent too.

""As always in football, it is a bit of both. The style of play you face always gives you challenges and with Villa, yes we took the ball off them to score a goal, but they also had a long and good attack when they scored for their second goal.

""Then we were unlucky not to score our chances and that is football unfortunately, but we cannot accept, me and the fans, they don't give maximum effort.

""I would prefer him to score, but the word 'chance' says it all, it is not 100 per cent certain it is going in and players miss chances,  that I can accept. ""But what was harder to accept was his behaviour after, it got too much in his head and he wasn't the usual Darwin that works his ass off and helps the team. ""He was too disappointed after missing that chance and maybe that was why he was a fraction short the moment after. ""It is always best to have Endo's mindset and for the whole season he keeps going and whenever we need him, he is always ready and that is very difficult, there are not many players who can do this. ""It's not about the chance, it is the 20 mins after it I want to talk to Darwin about rather than missing a chance. ""Going 2-1 down against Villa, which in my opinion was was completely against the run of play. I said at half-time I can show you all  the chances we created, I told them it wasn't logical, so I said keep going and we will definitely have chances. And that is also what we got. ""Unfortunately, too many times this season we have missed too many chances. What I mean by that is we haven't stolen many points, I always come back to the Chelsea game where a draw was maybe the right result, but for every other game I think we got what we deserve, or we deserved more, but that is more of a thing for me than Arsenal plays on Saturday and we play on Sunday!"""

""That doesn’t alter the fact that Liverpool can go 10 clear with victory at Villa Park, and take a massive step towards a second Premier League title over the next three games with Manchester City and Newcastle to come. ""Slot says he knows it’s going to be a challenge with Villa's home record, but did add that Liverpool have 'quite an okay away record' too. Calmness has been restored after the chaos of the Merseyside Derby and Liverpool have rediscovered the knack of winning games by a single goal. ""Six times they’ve managed that in their 25 league games so far, bookended by their narrow victories over Wolves. ""Go back to September at the 2-1 win at Molineux where they were pegged back with 35 minutes to go - five mins later, Salah’s penalty took all three points. ""The next league game after that was the 1-0 win away at Palace, which saw Jota score after 9 minutes.

Jackson equalised early in second half, and Liverpool immediately responded with Curtis Jones' goal which turned out to be the winner. ""There have been anomalies, coming away with a point from the Merseyside Derby, a draw away at Newcastle and conceding late on at home to Man United.

The 2-1 victory over Wolves may have restored the leaders’ seven-point lead over Arsenal but the second half, and final 25 minutes in particular, did not make for comfortable viewing for Reds fans. What should have been a straightforward win after goals from Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah turned into a nail-biter once the latter had a second ruled out for offside and then Matheus Cunha curled home. After Wednesday’s concession of an equaliser in the eighth minute of added time in Goodison Park’s final Merseyside derby there was a palpable air of anxiety. Van Dijk understood the frustration and said: “Get a grip? Yeah, well it is easier to say than actually do. We are all human beings and I totally understand anxiety or nervousness can kick in. “I said it weeks ago, we just have to buckle up, enjoy the ride. There will be a lot of twists and turns. “If you’re not ready for it – and we have been there already – it will be a difficult couple of months for you but I feel like we as a team are ready for it. “We will give it everything we’ve got and we will see in 13 games if that is enough. “It is all about game-by-game and not looking at others as we have no influence on other teams or other situations.”"

After the loss to Plymouth and draw at Everton, Arne Slot's side are back to winning ways via their 2-1 win over Wolves but was the victory the sign of champions or a team still feeling the pressure of a run-in? Liverpool did not play well at Anfield, especially in the second half. Slot's side managed zero shots after half-time and after Matheus Cunha's strike created a grandstand finish, they were one superb Jarell Quansah tackle away from Wolves and Marshall Munetsi getting an equaliser. It was an un-Liverpool performance - yet they still won. But they looked tired - and Slot agreed: ""It was maybe the first time this season that players were more tired than they were in other games."" So is the season and form starting to catch up with them? Whether it's resilience or a team starting to fade - what we do know is the next three games will decide which is which.

2/16/2025,17:48,Slot believes win over Wolves could prove to be important for Liverpool,"Liverpoolhead coachArne Slotbelieves the nervy 2-1 win over Wolves could be one of their most important victories of the season. The home side were comfortable at half-time thanks to goals from Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah but when Matheus Cunha pulled one back with 23 minutes remaining the Anfield anxiety levels went through the roof. That was exacerbated by the concession of an equaliser in the eighth minute of added time in Wednesday’s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park but Liverpool hung on to re-establish their seven-point lead at the top of the table. It was particularly significant as they travel to Aston Villa and Manchester City in the next week with a significant cushion over second-placed Arsenal. “Clearly it was relief in the end, especially after what happened on Wednesday,” Slot said. “The last minute when we conceded a goal (against Everton) you are so frustrated because you know that moment can have impact for the next game and the games that are coming up. “That was in our heads a bit and that is also why we as a team were so furious on Wednesday. “I think you saw today that after us conceding the 2-1 that maybe for the first time this season we were ‘Ooh’. “Today 2-0 up we had to deal with thinking we scored the 3-0, completely correct decision that he (referee Simon Hooper) disallowed it for offside and thinking we would score the 3-0 for the penalty – again, in my opinion, the correct decision by VAR to turn that decision over. “Then receiving the 2-1 that is mentally not always easy. “That’s why these wins are probably even more important than when you out-play Tottenham like we did here two weeks ago for 4-0 (in the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg. “If you don’t have the mentality to win difficult games then you will never achieve something.”"

""You can never breathe in this competition. Arsenal are on a 15-game unbeaten run with 10 wins, five draws. During these 15 games, the gap has always been seven points.

""But in a season where you want to achieve something, no matter what you want to achieve, you need to have wins like this as well. Two weeks ago, we played fantastic football when we beat Spurs 4-0, that's in a season. But wins like this should also be in a season like this. ""It's never the game plan, not to create anything at all! We did have a few promising situations, but one of them was disallowed for offside, one of them was a penalty overturned by VAR. We were by far not enough of a goal threat in the second half. ""But that was partly due to Wolves taking a lot of risks in one v one situations. The team felt that to bring this win over the line, defending was a bit more important than attacking a lot. That was the end result, but ideally we play a better second half. ""If that is what is needed to win a game, then I'm happy to see that these players can do it as well. ""You always wonder if it comes from running a lot of mental fatigue after all the events that happened in the last game and the last eight minutes against Everton.

But then conceding 2-1 afterwards, that was a mental test. We did that very good. But if you feel the stress, maybe you feel a bit tired.

Cunha was a danger man for them today we had to be aware of. Unfortunately he scored but we kept them to that. ""I definitely give them credit the way they went one v one most of the times and how they found the free man between the lines.

Slot is facing a possible touchline ban after he was sent off by referee Michael Oliver after the full-time whistle, having just seen James Tarkowski score an injury-time equaliser to earn the hosts a 2-2 draw. Moyes said: “I feel a bit for Arne Slot because this is the thing when I was a younger manager, I was always getting involved in heated things. “It shows he cares about his club and he’s fighting for his players.”"
2/14/2025,09:45,Slot: Emotions got the better of me in derby,"LiverpoolbossArne Slotadmitted “emotions got the better of me” after his red card at the end of a dramatic final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Wednesday night. Slot was sent off by referee Michael Oliver after the full-time whistle having seen Everton defender James Tarkowski score in the eighth minute of time added on to earn a 2-2 draw on a historic night. The Dutchman is now waiting for the FA to review Oliver’s match report before he finds out what – if any – sanction he will face. Depending on the contents of that report, Slot could face no further action, be reminded of his responsibilities, or be charged, which would likely result in a touchline ban. Due to the ongoing process, he did not speak about details, but admitted he “made the wrong decision”. “There is an ongoing process now and I have to respect that,” he said ahead of Saturday’s visit of Wolves. “I think what happened was that the extra five minutes ended up being eight. It happened a lot. “Emotions got the better of me. If I could do that differently, if I look back I would love to do that differently and I hope to do that differently next time. “There is an ongoing process and I don’t want to disturb that. “I should have acted differently after the game but it’s an emotional sport and sometimes individuals make wrong decisions and that’s definitely what I did. “There were many things in extra time that led to me being quite emotional. There was a foul incident and then two minutes they checked, I thought the only thing would be a foul or maybe offside. “Of course then after 10 minutes you hear their fans cheering, OK, it wasn’t offside. Many things happened in the end phase in extra time but it wouldn’t be smart to go into every single incident.”"

James Tarkowski’s late equaliser sparked wild scenes with Everton’s Doucoure celebrating in front of the travelling supporters before Jones intervened. “I like a lot that he stands up for the team, but there are also other ways for the team and fans to do that,” Slot added. “I will talk with him about that. It is the same for me, I should have acted differently after the game as well.” Liverpool were on course to earn victory on the historic occasion and strengthen their grip on the Premier League title race until the late drama. Slot added: “I felt immediately after the referee blew his whistle we had lost two points. “For the whole 98 minutes it didn’t feel constantly we were the ones who were going to win the game, it was an equal game, a draw was maybe a fair result but with us leading after 97 minutes we were quite close to winning the game and it felt as though we dropped two points. “But we won a lot as well with the togetherness of the team, together with the fans, how much we fought to get the result over the line.”"

Alexander-Arnold has been linked with a move to the LaLiga giants when his contract expires in the summer. Benitez, who also managed Real Madrid, believes it would suit the 26-year-old. ""He’s an offensive defender and he’s playing as a midfielder sometimes,"" Benitez toldSky Sports. ""Real Madrid is an attacking team, the best team in Spain and they will be the best team because they have the potential. ""For an offensive defender in an offensive team, you have more chances to make assists and create situations in attack – they will be good for him as a player. ""He’s doing that at Liverpool but with Real Madrid, you can guarantee he will do that for years. ""As a Liverpool fan, you would say him staying is much better because he gives us something special. But if he goes, and as a Real Madrid kid all my life, it will also be good for Real Madrid and for him."" Van Dijk and Salah's contracts also expire at the end of the season and Benitez reckons Liverpool will not keep all three. ""It will not be easy to keep the three players, that is very clear,"" said Benitez. ""The three are very important players but if the club is working on replacements, if the club is making the right approach to them, they will sort it out. ""I don’t know if the three of them [will stay], I don’t think so. ""If they cannot, I’m sure they will have a new option and the new player will come and will be another kind of player with energy and give something different."""

Liverpool are currently seven points clear ofArsenalat the top of the table but squandered the chance to make it nine after conceding a late equaliser againstEvertonto make it 2-2 on Wednesday. ""It is always difficult to control yourself in every situation. Especially when you go into a derby and know what it means for all the fans and your staff. ""You have the game in your hand then you lose the possibility to get three points. It is not easy to have control, especially when everyone expects you to have passion. ""It is not nice but it is a derby, you move on."" On the title race, he added: ""When you fight for title, normally we say the last ten games are the key games. That is when you win trophies or the leagues. ""They have balance and a team that is capable of scoring goals but also good defending. When you have good players with good players, you win titles. Liverpool are in the advantage and they have the right mentality. ""The coach is doing well so he understands what he needs to do, he changes the way they play depending on the opponent.

I think the referee had a big part in the game today in terms of certain challenges were given as a foul and similar ones didn’t. It’s disappointing to concede – a great strike – but very disappointing.” What did Everton do well?“The same things they always do – very direct and fight for the second and third ball. This is their cup final and will try and make it difficult. We saw it last season how difficult they made it and this year they scored in the end – a boost for them, a blow for us.” On late red cards:“They are entitled to celebrate the goal but Doucoure wanted to provoke our fans and Curtis thought that wasn’t the right thing to do.

2/11/2025,16:18,Liverpool's next five league games may decide the title,"Analysis by Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: Liverpool now face a potentially season-defining run of five Premier League games in 15 days that could go a long way in deciding the outcome this campaign’s title race. The Reds’ progression to the Carabao Cup final on Sunday March 16 means their top-flight clash at Aston Villa, originally scheduled for that weekend, has been brought forward to Wednesday February 19. As a result, Arne Slot’s side can now concentrate on their league campaign, with Liverpool six points ahead of second-placed Arsenal ahead of Wednesday night’s game at Everton - the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park and their game in hand on the Gunners. Liverpool then host Wolves at Anfield on Sunday afternoon – live onSky Sports– before that testing trip to Villa Park a week on Wednesday, followed by another challenging game at champions Man City [Sunday February 23] - live onSky Sports–and the visit of League Cup finalists Newcastle to Anfield [Wednesday February 26] rounds off this scary-looking run. By that point, it will be the Reds who would have played a match more than their rivals and with then just 10 fixtures left in the season, we will well and truly be into the home straight. But whether the Premier League title ends up on Merseyside, or in north London this season, still may not be known by then if recent title fights are anything to go by, as Slot pointed out in his pre-match press conference ahead of Wednesday’s derby. ""This period, five games in 15 days, is what we've done for 15 months now,"" said the Dutchman. ""Last season Arsenal only lost two of their last 15 or 17, but still Man City were able to win the league probably because they won every game. “That is the league we are in, so the upcoming five fixtures are important, but the nine afterwards are important. But the first 23-24 games have been just as important."" Liverpool next five games"

""We would definitely have prepared to play six games in 18 days or seven in 21 or eight in 24 because that's the schedule we are in. Now with us losing this game, there is one moment that we have a normal week, but that is definitely not what we wanted when we went to Plymouth. ""It was difficult because the plan was to play with Joe [Gomez] for 60 minutes or longer. The plan was to start Curtis [Jones] but he came on Sunday and said he didn't feel well enough to play so then all of a sudden we missed two important players. I think people know Darwin [Nunez's] situation that he became a dad one or two days before the game and that happened in Spain, so he came in a bit later. ""There were some circumstances that weren't perfect when it comes to Plymouth. The idea was to play with an even stronger team, but that team still should have been able to win that game and the fact that we didn't and the fact that we didn't against PSV [Eindhoven] as well also tells us that these players definitely need these games to get the best out of them.

""He reiterated losing to Plymouth is unacceptable and so now, in the Merseyside derby, they have to show a different side because the result and performance were far from the standards expected. ""The team he fielded, of course, was very different as well. At Goodison Park we can expect to see Mo Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahim Konate, Alisson, Andy Robertson, Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai or Curtis Jones return to the starting lineup at the very least. ""Trent Alexander-Arnoldwill also train ahead of the game and a decision as to whether or not he’s ready to return will be taken from there. ""Joe Gomezis definitely out and there's concern around the fact that he's suffered another hamstring injury in the same leg, having only just returned. ""Aside from that, Slot again has the best part of a fully-fit squad to choose from for the last-ever Goodison Park Merseyside derby. ""Both sides are tied on 41 wins at the famous old stadium and given the emotion there will be amongst the home support at least, Slot is calling for cool heads, but not cool legs. ""So calmness of mind whilst maintaining the intensity of work rate and commitment is key, and even though Liverpool have a six-point advantage at the top of the Premier League, the Dutchman believes they can't slow down. “'You cannot have a few games where you are not on top of your game,' he says, 'because then all of a sudden another team catches you up. That’s what the Premier League is, that’s why it’s such an exciting league and such a beautiful league to work in.'"""
2/11/2025,10:21,Slot: We cannot slow down now as we will be caught,"Liverpool manager Arne Slot on Liverpool's upcoming run of five matches in the next 15 days: ""This period, five games in 15 days, is what we've done for 15 months now. This is the hardest league to win because so many teams can win this league and are capable of winning 10-15 games in a row, so you cannot slow down and you cannot have a few games where you aren't on the top of your game because all of a sudden another team will catch you up. ""That is what the Premier League is, that's why it is such an exciting league and such a beautiful league to work in. ""Last season Arsenal only lost two of their last 15 or 17, but still City were able to win the league probably because they won every game.

When David Moyes took over in 2002, they were fighting relegation and he made it a club that competing for top four. So he has done incredibly well. ""But the last few seasons, they were not competing for the top four anymore and a team like Liverpool would normally get more points against teams around Everton than the ones over here. ""So that tells you how difficult the away leg for Liverpool is when they play Everton away. That we all know and I have been working in football long enough to know derbies are always more difficult than facing a team who are around the same position as Everton in the table - that is clear as fans bring the best out of players ""I have experienced this already a few times at Anfield, and many times at my former club [Feyenoord], but I hope I don't experience it tomorrow!

""I am aware of the fact that David [Moyes] took over four games ago and he has won three, so that is definitely a great accomplishment for him and they are now in a better place than they were a few months ago. ""But the weather circumstances are now in a better situation as well!"""
2/11/2025,09:49,"Slot: We need cool heads, but not cool legs","Liverpool manager Arne Slot on the importance of keeping a cool ahead on Wednesday night: ""Cool heads, but not cool legs. Every time you play against a team that wants to fight with you - and that is every time we play an opponent - this one even more, you have to be ready for that. You have to run and tackle even more - not crossing the line, but being cool enough to play a good and firm tackle. That's where it starts with and then nine out of 10 times it then settles down after 10-15 minutes it settles down a bit and then you can think even more about playing football. ""But last season there were about 10-15 free kicks for Everton and we know what they did with them, they brought them in every time and it led in the end to their 1-0."" ""So yes, cool heads, but not cool legs."""
2/11/2025,09:31,Slot: Never easy to play in an atmosphere like Goodison,"Liverpool manager Arne Slot on the atmosphere expected at what will be the final-ever Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Wednesday night: ""It's an extra reason why the atmosphere will be even better than all the occasions before, although I have not been to one, I am told it is always a fantastic atmosphere at Goodison Park, as it is an Anfield. ""That is never easy to play in, every single time they cross the halfway line, or get a corner, the fans will cheer for that, so you have to be mentally really strong as an away team to resist all that and still be focussed on what you have to do - defend corner, the set piece and then be calm when you have the ball. ""But it is not first time these players have been in atmospheres like this. But it is not only tactical, it is also about standing up to those emotions. I hope they can focus on what they do because I noticed in the Plymouth game, the intensity of the tackles was because of the emotions in the stadium. So we have to be up for that. ""I have seen last season's game, we were ready, but in the first 10 minutes, the ref blew his whistle 11 times for Everton in the first ten minutes - So i assume our players will be ready for another battle tomorrow for the simple reason they've been ready all season and many are experienced."""

Today was a big chance for him to show his quality and that he can be a big figure for Liverpool in the business end of the season. But he was well short of the level required at Home Park. He attempted 10 take-ons. And completed one. In the final third, barely half of his passes were completed, while just one of his four crosses found their target. He just couldn't find a way past the green shirts in front of him and when he sent a late cross straight out for a goal-kick, Arne Slot looked exasperated. Of course, Chiesa is likely still short of match fitness. But his frustrating time at Liverpool from a personal perspective looks set to continue for a while yet, on this evidence. Sky Sports"

""They still had enough quality on the pitch to go and beat Plymouth, who have conceded the most goals in all the leagues this season. ""It was an opportunity for players and it didn't work out for them. It happens in football. That's the only blot for Slot. ""Since he's come to Liverpool all we've done is praise him.

But Salah wasn't there. Neither was Virgil van Dijk, Alexis Mac Allister, Ibrahima Konate, Dominik Szoboszlai, Cody Gakpo and Ryan Gravenberch. In-form first-team players that would have made Plymouth sweat. Instead Arne Slot could only turn to debutants Isaac Mabaya and Trent Kone-Doherty - and the erratic Darwin Nunez. Slot has got little, if anything wrong, in his time in the Liverpool hotseat but this was a clear underestimation of the challenge ahead. Name a freshened-up team, of course, but to not have the big guns in reserve for any emergencies was just plain irresponsible in a competition that Liverpool have serious tradition of taking seriously. Slot disrespected the competition, did Plymouth's team talk for them and the famous old competition delivered him a harsh lesson. Sky Sports"

He appeared to pull up while chasing back towards his own goal. Isaac Mabayacame on to replace of the England international, who could now be facing more time on the sidelines. Asked if it was Gomez's injury was a reoccurrence of the problem he picked up at West Ham, Slot said: “Not too sure it was the same leg as West Ham. I haven’t had time to ask him. It was clear that we knew which moment he felt insecure. Because he didn’t spirit back fully. He said 'I’m afraid if I make one extra sprint things will go wrong'. ""It’s not torn, I assume."" Slot also explained why unused substituteCurtis Jones' absence impacted his team selection. Slot made 10 changes to the team that beat Spurs last time out in the Carabao Cup, including starts for youngsters Trey Nyoni and James McConnell. ""Curtis Jones was on the bench and said to me he doesn’t think he is fully recovered yet after yesterday’s training session,"" Slot said. ""That led to the fact that there were a few more youngsters on the pitch than was the idea before the game. But still, there was enough quality on the pitch to get a better result than this."""

His celebrations sounded equally as nice. A quiet glass of wine after his media obligations had been fulfilled. Once that was done it was already late and he was due to see us again at 10:15am on Friday. ""Predictably there was no sign of weariness. As sharp as ever he saw the Virgil van Dijk question coming…. his hopes for Virgil’s future [in light of Van Dijk’s comments toSky Sports'Juliette Ferrington that he has no idea what it will bring just yet] ‘good health’ and that he can ‘enjoy working with him for a long time’. After all he’s in the Jamie Carragher camp when it comes to assessing the ease with which Van Dijk plays the game. ""It wouldn’t be a surprise either if Van Dijk was part of the rotation for the Plymouth game. There clearly will be changes as Slot balances resting players with building up match sharpness in others. Sky Sports ""What came across is the care he has for his players. We saw that visibly from his predecessor with the Jurgen hugs…. Slot shows it with ensuring a better work-life balance for his squad, allowing them greater time to be fathers and husbands, where even the small details like staying at home the night before a home game helps. ""Aside from Trent Alexander-Arnold [and Tyler Morton, who has a shoulder injury], Slot has pretty much a fully-fit squad to choose from… that’s an added bonus at this stage of the season when challenging on all four fronts.

He's been outstanding for this club for so many years, and since I'm working here he's been outstanding for me as well, for the performances he brings in. Yesterday was again an example of that. “He was also, in a good way, in a good manner, aggressive. He led the team in a way, with the ball we all know what he can do, but also without the ball he was sharp and ready. It was not a coincidence that it took 80 minutes before they had their first shot on target. “So Virgil, like many others, has a good season, but he wants, just like all the others, to make it a great season, and therefore we have to play still many games.” What do you hope the future brings for him? “A good health for him and his family, that's the first thing I wish him.

""In Holland we only have one cup competition and that final is played at the end of the season so it is new experience but a nice one to have. ""It is a special stadium for English people but also for Dutch people because we know the history of the stadium and final as well.

So it is difficult to control the game but we did it really well and it took them 80 minutes before they had a shot on target. It was a very good performance from our side. ""There are many games to be played. We were lucky, maybe not lucky, that we were already qualified after six games in the Champions League so we were still able to rotate. This is a league where you play the most games but you are only able to take 20 players. ""If you play so many games you need more than 20 players. If a club like us should always have 20, 21, 22 first-team players and behind it we can take more academy players then a game like today would have been ideal ""There is only one downside to reaching the final, it is playing Villa in midweek but being successful creates even more games. It is a positive and players get stronger in my opinion by playing games."""

He told Sky Sports: ""There is only one man at Liverpool that does not want Trent Alexander-Arnold to sign a new contract - Conor Bradley. ""If Trent moves on he needs to be Liverpool's right-back.

Arne Slot's side wanted to sign Zubimendi in the summer but the Real Sociedad midfielder opted to stay in Spain for another season. He is now expected to join Arsenal from next season. That transfer miss allowed Liverpool to select Gravenberch in defensive midfield for all of this season, with Carragher describing the Dutchman as a revelation. ""On the Zubimendi thing, I'm not just being clever after the event: this [playing Gravenberch in defensive midfield] has worked out much better for Liverpool,"" Carragher told Sky Sports. ""Even when Liverpool were going for Zubimendi, I didn't see how him and Mac Allister would play together. ""For me, it felt like the same player. Two really good players and one is a No 6 and one is a No 8, but no great legs at all in legs. ""What Gravenberch has given Liverpool this season is energy and legs. ""When Liverpool were trialling out No 6 positions in pre-season, everyone had a go at it. Curtis Jones had a go, Gravenberch did it Szoboszlai did it ""He was almost trialling players before he knew or not whether he could get Zubimendi. They weren't fully sure about him because they felt he was an attacking player. ""When they decided on him, I was really intrigued. I couldn't see him in that position, Bayern Munich had him in that position and said he couldn't do it. That's why Liverpool signed him. ""The biggest compliment I could give him is that if Liverpool went on to win the league, he would be in the running for player of the year. And the person you'd say he reminisces a little bit, and he's not there yet, is Patrick Vieira, where you look at those long legs. It's Vieira-like, people can't keep up with him."""

""They'll have to get through the first 15 minutes and the first 25, get to half-time. It's the only way they can play. ""If you're looking at form and you're looking at the teams at the moment, the way they're playing, it's a complete and utter mismatch, but we've seen enough football over our lives that it doesn't always work like that. ""And if Tottenham can put in a performance like they did at home to Liverpool or even when they went to Man City or Brentford the weekend, they score a goal, it's a different game then.

The Reds face the prospect of losing key trioVan Dijk, Mohamed SalahandTrent Alexander-Arnoldwhen their contracts expire at the end of the season, but Barnes believes the departure of their Dutch captain would cause the biggest concern. Van Dijk has been pivotal to Liverpool's success in recent years and has featured in all 23 of their Premier League matches this season as they challenge for the title, sitting six points clear of Arsenal at the top of the table. The 33-year-old has been at the club since 2017, making more than 300 appearances and helping them win the Premier League and Champions League, and Barnes believes extending his contract should be the priority. Speaking at aLiveScorelive fan event in Liverpool, the former England international said: ""We want them all to stay, but if youwere to put them in order, I would say Virgil is the most important. ""I don't think we could cope with losing him. In terms of importance, Virgil is most important. It would be great to have all three of them and the club have no control of that."""

The 19-year-old forward has a problem with his back. Danns has to go back to Liverpool for treatment and rehabilitation, but will still be registered as a Sunderland player. He will be able to come back to Sunderland and play once the problem is treated. ""Danns will complete a period of rehabilitation to return from a back injury that was identified during the medical process,"" said a statement on the Sunderland website when announcing the deal. ""The first stages of his recovery will take place at Liverpool's AXA Training Centre and we look forward to welcoming Jayden back to Wearside in due course."" Prior to completing his loan move, Danns penned a new contract at Liverpool on Monday, defined only as 'long-term'."
2/4/2025,07:30,An expectedly quiet window for Liverpool,"Sky Sports News' Vinny O'Connor: It was the window we were always expecting from the moment Arne Slot made the point he wasn't desperate for new signings in the summer, so it would be strange to perform a U-turn on that in January. And it's easy to see the logic. Liverpool currently enjoy a six-point lead in the Premier League title race, they finished top of the Champions League standings and they are 90 minutes away from a return to Wembley in another League Cup final - albeit they have a one-goal deficit to overturn at home to Spurs. The caveat, as ever, was if one of their long-term targets became available and they needed to make a move then they would. That didn't happen and they didn't need to spend money by bringing in numbers for the sake of it. Sky Sports Injury wise, Joe Gomez is close to a return while Trent Alexander-Arnold isn't expected to be sidelined for too long. Federico Chiesa - Liverpool's one summer signing - is beginning to contribute after being hampered by injury. Harvey Elliott is getting back to his best and James McConnell seemingly has a part to play between now and the end of the season, so Liverpool have, at the very least, two players for each position. A quiet window also means that, financially at least, Liverpool are in a strong position to go after their targets in the summer. Then, they will know exactly the scale of the rebuild required as the futures of Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold will have been determined. Yes, there hasn't been the excitement of a signing that could be looked upon as enhancing Liverpool's quest for multiple successes this season, but it's a measured approach that may pay greater dividends in the long term."

The Liverpool star has been involved in 34 of his team’s 56 goals – a higher percentage than any other player in the Premier League this season. Asked if he sees it as an issue for Arne Slot, Carragher said: “I don’t think it is this season because he is having one of those all-time Premier League seasons. More often than not he gets 20 to 25 goals, I think this season he is going to get 30 to 35 goals. “Mo Salah, if he signs, and hopefully he does, I don’t think he will get these numbers for the next two or three years because this is one of those seasons that we will all remember, very similar to his first season at the club. “Even if he signs, I think next season they will need more from the two players we have highlighted [ Luis Diaz and Dominik Szoboszlai]. You look at Szoboszlai this season and he has five goals and assists. You need more from that position. “That actually excites me about Liverpool under Arne Slot.

""If those players were available right now, I’m not sure they would do the attacking ones because they have enough numbers there. ""But I think they need to sign a left-back – or a left-sided centre-back or left-back – but I am sure they will come in the summer.

So he felt something, I cannot tell you exactly what and how bad it is, of course, because we are one hour after the game. But it's never a good sign if a player is asking for a substitution. ""So I would be surprised, this is not a fact, but I would be surprised if he plays on the first day. But let's hope he's back with us as soon as possible."" On the game... ""It was [a real battle] as expected. So I said before the game that after our home game, when we were 3-0 up at half-time, the way they came at us the second half, I already knew what a great mentality this team has, and quality as well. ""And from that moment onwards, they've done so well in the league, and they've picked up points against so many good teams, not by luck, but because they're intense, they have quality, and that's why we knew it was always going to be very hard. If you want to win here, maybe you need a bit of luck as well, because the margins are so small. Our penalty was just not offside, and their goal on 1-1 was on a margin offside, they hit the post twice, we had our chances as well, but it was a close call for us to win this game."" Are you pleased with the way your players stood up to the physicality? Because there can't be many games this season where it's quite so tough…. ""No, that's true. Only a few of them have been at a place like this, and that's what I've told them before, that in all the data when it comes to running, they are so high up in the list. “So we knew that if we would have had any chance of a result over here, we at least had to compete with them in terms of running and fighting, and playing the duels and all these things. I think that's what the players did today. Then having Mo Salah definitely helps in a game like this. Praise for Alisson ""If you want to win here against a team that is so competitive, you need a team performance and work rate, that's what we have, and you need some quality individuals that can make the difference for you, and that goal of Mo was absolute quality. And the saves Alisson made as well, but it was not only them, just the way our centre-backs were defending again today was also impressive. “So team performance, work rate, incredible. The only way to have a chance or a result, and then you need good individual performance, and you need positive margins, like I just explained to both our sides, that were in our favour.” Fine margins and 15 more games to go... ""Almost every game feels like this for me. So many of our games have been, until the end, exciting, and there were a few moments already this season where I felt we were just not on the right side, so all the points we've got until now, I think we deserve them. ""I've said many times already, the Chelsea game, that's under debate then maybe, and this game, yeah, we weren't unlucky, let's put it that way, but Fulham at home, being 2-2, getting chance after chance, United at home, getting chance after chance at 2-2, and there was another game for us that ended in a draw, with us getting chance after chance at the end of the game. “What I want from them and what they want from each other is that they fight in every single game, from the first to the last second, to get the maximum result, and that's what the fans expect from them. Playing for this club, and that's what we try to do in every single game, and that's also what's necessary if you want to have any chance of a result in this league. On Ryan Gravenberch being pushed towards the right-hand side to cater for Kerkez... ""Not many things that we do are just by coincidence, so I think it's clear that they have many good things, this team, but their left full-back is definitely a threat going forwards. Mo Salah is an incredible player, but his main strength is not following the opposite full-back. “Some people are laughing over here, I don't know why that is [smiles]. But that's not the only thing, we want to keep Mo as much as we can forwards as well, because it is a risk for every team that plays us."" Answer on penalty incident having been told that 'online it is being talked about'... ""Online there's always controversy, especially from fans that are probably not in favour of Liverpool. ""The only thing I can say is, and I haven't seen it back, is that one of my players is on a clear 1-v-1 to the goalkeeper, and he's falling down. So either he makes a ‘schwalbe’... Is that an English word? A dive? Either he makes a dive... It's a German word. Either he makes a dive, or they touch him, and if they touch him, then for me it's a penalty. ""And if then it would not have even been a chance, you're always like, yeah, is this really a penalty then? But this was such a clear 1-on-1 chance, that if he touched him, which I assume he did, otherwise the VR would have probably interfered."" Asked if Kerkez is a player he is interested in this summer... ""I don't think I have to talk about players that we are interested in, let alone a player from Bournemouth. ""He's playing over here, he's having a great season, as many, many, many other players here as well. And that shows you probably how good of a manager you have over here, and what a great sports director you had over here, and maybe still have. I don't know how he's doing now. ""But he brought in very good players, and this manager works with him in an incredible way because he brings the best out of every single player. Including the one you just mentioned, but I'm not talking about an individual. They are all doing, bringing the best out of their game at the moment. Final answer on the close penalty call and fine margins to win titles... ""I can come up with three, four, five examples where we didn't have the luck we deserved, or we didn't get the decision we deserved. ""But that's always the difficult thing in football. If there's one in your favour, people will probably tell you, there's always that luck for Liverpool, or for the one that's number one at the moment. So, yeah, for me, this has nothing to do with luck. ""It's a clear 1-v-1. And I can tell you if Cody Gakpo goes 1-v-1 to the goalkeeper, it's quite a big chance as well. Yeah, if you are then tripped. ""It is a penalty and it's not like it's a penalty from a little push from a set-piece and it wasn't even a chance. So, I wouldn't call this luck unless I see it back and I see he didn't touch him at all. Yeah, then it was not luck, then it was a wrong decision by the referee and the VAR, but I assume that that was not the situation."""
2/1/2025,18:14,Slot gives view on penalty - Gakpo had no reason to dive,"LiverpoolbossArne Slothas had his say on the key first-half penalty incident during his side's 2-0 win at Bournemouth. Cody Gakpo seemed to have got clear of Lewis Cook as the pair chased a long ball into the home side's box. The Liverpool player tripped, though there was more than a suggestion that he may have stumbled over his own foot. VAR upheld Darren England's on-field decision, and from the spot Salah slipped the ball just beyond the dive of Kepa for 1-0. Slot believes there was no reason for Gakpo to go to ground inside the box when presented with a clear goalscoring opportunity. ""Online there's always controversy, especially from fans that are probably not in favour of Liverpool,"" the Dutchman said when it was mentioned a social media storm had ensued. ""The only thing I can say is, and I haven't seen it back, is that one of my players is on a clear 1-v-1 to the goalkeeper, and he's falling down. ""So either he makes a ‘schwalbe’...

He felt something, I can't tell you exactly what it is because it is only now an hour after it happened but it is never a good sign if the player is asking for a substitution. ""I would be surprised if he plays on Thursday but let's hope he is back as soon as possible."""
2/1/2025,17:33,Slot: We needed luck to win!,"Liverpool manager Arne Slot speaking to Sky Sports: ""It was the game we expected. They are so intense, they keep running and keep fighting every second. I said before the game, we were 3-0 up at Anfield at half-time and they kept going. We had to play at the top of our abilities and needed luck to win this game. ""The luck? I meant they hit the bar or the post two times and they were constantly truing to force things. They had other chances as well and I don't think we actually controlled the game. It was an open and even game which everyone has here, because all the teams struggle here. ""It's a very good team and a very good manager. It was difficult for us as well and was good for us to score two goals. ""Alisson does incredibly well. He's been so important for so many years. It's not for me to judge who is the best in the world or the league, but I'm happy to have such a good goalkeeper. ""The second goal was the difference between the two teams. It wasn't an easy or a simple chance, the way Salah scores is so calm. It shows you how much quality he has to win a game like this. The rest of the team and him worked so hard to keep the clean sheet. ""I don't think I could have asked more than where we are at the moment. In general, this was a close call. And the Chelsea game was similar. All the other games we deserved to get the points, some other situations we deserved more than we got."""
2/1/2025,17:27,REPORT: Salah double helps Liverpool open up nine-point lead in title race,"Liverpool established an ominous nine-point lead at the Premier League summit after Mohamed Salah's double secured a hard-fought 2-0 win over Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium. Salah opened the scoring after 30 minutes from 12 yards after Lewis Cook tripped Cody Gakpo inside the penalty area. It was the Egyptian's 177th Premier League goal, going level with sixth-placed Frank Lampard in the all-time top scorers' charts - and he surpassed the former Chelsea midfielder with a gorgeous trademark finish (75). Sky Sports But the result for Liverpool was slightly overshadowed by Trent Alexander-Arnold being forced off with a muscle injury during the second half. Justin Kluivert's glaring miss with the goal at his mercy midway through the second period proved critical as Salah superbly curled in his decisive second just four minutes later to puncture the chasing pack's hopes of a twist in the title race. Antoine Semenyo went close twice, rattling the post before drawing a fine save from Alisson, but the hosts were unable to make it a quadruple of home wins against the division's top-four sides having prised the scalps of Arsenal, Manchester City and Nottingham Forest prior to Saturday's showdown."
2/1/2025,17:26,Processional feel to title charge now,"Sky Sports' Ben Grounds at the Vitality Stadium: We are now beyond the point where the most pertinent question concerning Liverpool is whether or not Slot's dad thinks they have played well. The question of whether his side will win the Premier League in his first season in charge can surely no longer be up for debate. They still haven't played anyone? Surely even the most scarred and pessimistic Liverpudlian must now accept that it is a foregone conclusion. The waning degree of media attention on the serenity of Slot will not concern those who crave the column inches. Even the chatter of Alexander-Arnold's contract has fallen silent. Of greater concern immediately will be the severity of the muscle injury he sustained on the south coast. Competition, and the chase, is what neutrals want but it is time to gloss over Liverpool until the inevitable trophy parade. The best team in the league, with the most complete squad, the fewest injuries that matter and crucially the respect now of all their opponents. Iraola - like Thomas Frank a couple of weeks ago - decreed they are the best in the league, indeed the best in Europe. His team were beaten for the first time since November 23. It was always likely to take a special outfit to end that impressive sequence. Champions League top dogs and now nine points clear at their domestic summit. They are still to face Everton twice but they can now afford to lose both games and not be caught, such is their superior goal difference to Arsenal. A stumble would make good copy but you cannot pick at vulnerabilities that don't stack up compared to the issues among rivals. The gap, in truth, is only likely to get wider."

""I would be surprised if there's anyone wherever around the world saying 'we don't want Mo Salah'. ""He's doing so well for so many years that everybody probably wants him. And he's done so well without my advice for a long time. So he can probably keep doing what is best for his career, even without my advice.

McConnell slotted into midfield and played the full 90 minutes as Liverpool secured top spot in the league phase despite surrendering a lead to the Dutch league leaders. Asked whether there would be a chance some young players would depart on loan before the January transfer window deadline, Slot said: “There’s always a chance in life. At the moment we have most of our players fit, so we will have this discussion tomorrow I think, me and Richard [Hughes], about these players. “But there’s definitely one of them that will not go on loan and I think you know which one I mean, James McConnell. “I wouldn’t say definitely, but I liked him a lot today – so maybe now the end result today is that it would be good for him to go somewhere and play. “He was also one of our players who hadn’t played 90 minutes in the last six or seven months because he was injured for a while, and he impressed me a lot today. ”"

Results went our way elsewhere so we finish top and that's what we wanted at the start of the season."" On youngsters getting an opportunity:""They were really good.

However, midfielder Curtis Jones, who missed Saturday’s win over Ipswich with a groin problem, and striker Diogo Jota, who has been out for a fortnight with a muscle injury, have yet to rejoin the squad. Gomez, 27, has missed seven matches since sustaining a hamstring injury at West Ham on December 29. But the centre-back was with the main group for an open training session before the squad flew to the Netherlands for their final Champions League group match against PSV Eindhoven. In his absence Slot has had to rotate Jarell Quansah, 21, with Ibrahima Konate, who has been playing with pain after coming back from a knee injury, in the back four alongside virtual ever-present Virgil van Dijk. Gomez’s return may see him included in the travelling party for PSV, although he is realistically only likely to get a place on the bench. Liverpool, who have won all seven of their Champions League matches, need a point to secure top spot in the table but, with a tricky test at high-flying Bournemouth on Saturday, Slot is likely to rest a number of first-choice players in Eindhoven."

He can show his quality week in, week out and every few days. I am very impressed with him. Not only on the pitch but outside the pitch as well. “He is still a young boy but he is growing into a man.

""It’s been a few times we have played a home game and conceded a goal at the start. Today is the way you want to start a game,"" he said. ""We were aggressive, dominant for 85 minutes, they had hardly been in our half. ""It is a counter-attacking threat with the wingers they have but we managed to control that so because of the amount of work we put in. ""At the end, we are all all disappointed conceding from a corner, the first one this season, but for 85 minutes it was almost a perfect performance against a team that plays a low block. ""That’s not always easy but the way we did it was really good."" Salah reached yet another of his many landmarks with his 19th league goal of the season but it was off the ball which pleased Slot, with the Egypt international racing back over the halfway line in the second half to snuff out an attack. ""Mostly about Mo it’s his contract or his goals and now it’s his defensive work rate. I think that stood out,"" added the Reds boss. ""But if you look at almost all the times we have lost the ball, I saw a reaction off many players. ""It’s so difficult to control a counter-attack and the only way to do so is what Mo did in this moment and other players in different moments.

Among many impressive performances, the 24-year-old was Liverpool's outstanding player in the 4-1 win, setting up Mohamed Salah's goal with a far-post cross in addition to scoring twice himself. His double takes him to eight goals in the Premier League this season, equalling his total for the whole of last term with four months to spare. He is clearly relishing the opportunity to play consistently on the left having mostly been used in the central striker role by Jurgen Klopp. It is a tactical change which continues to bear fruit for Slot. ""I really do love it,"" Gakpo said afterwards. ""It's amazing scoring in front of the fans. But most important was the win. I'm very happy."""

""I'm always trying to spy an angle or two to get the big underdog onside but such is the relentless nature of Liverpool and the state of Ipswich's defending against Man City it was an impossible task. ""The approach from Kieran McKenna will surely be the same as their 1-0 defeat to Arsenal where they retreated into a low block and soaked up pressure.

""Ipswich have conceded an average of 8.8 corners on the road this season against top-half teams whilst Liverpool have got into double figures for corners won against Southampton, Leicester, Wolves, Brentford and in the away fixture with Ipswich.

""And then I have to try to explain to him that these games you can easily lose if you're starting to force all kinds of difficult balls. But he's not always agreeing with me then. ""As a manager, I was quite happy with our performance against Lille because they were a team that are so well organised and so much control. ""There was one moment in the game I can remember that Curtis (Jones) tried to play, at the halfway line, a ball that was a bit of risk and we lost that ball and they counter-attacked us. ""That's the risk you have if you play against a low-block team. Forest is probably the best in the league if you play these stupid balls, which I call stupid balls, which my father would love to see us playing a bit more. ""It's a balance we have to find and I can understand that it's sometimes difficult for fans as well that come to the stadium to see us winning but hopefully are scoring a lot of goals and an exciting match.

1/23/2025,00:07,Where do Liverpool rank in Money table?,"Matchday revenue for Europe’s 20 biggest-earning clubs surpassed two billion euros for the first time last season amid fan protests over ticket pricing. Data published by Deloitte on Thursday showed the top 20 clubs in its Football Money League earned 2.1 billion euros (£1.8bn) from matchdays in 2023-24, making it their fastest-growing revenue area – up 11 per cent compared to the previous season. Matchday revenue also accounted for a greater share of clubs’ total revenue – 18 per cent – than it had since the 2014-15 season, Deloitte found. That comes at a time when fans in England – home to nine of the top 20 teams in the Deloitte standings – continue to call on clubs to stop exploiting supporters’ loyalty, in particular what they see as an attack on concessionary pricing for the young and old. That comes at a time when fans in England – home to nine of the top 20 teams in the Deloitte standings – continue to call on clubs to stop exploiting supporters’ loyalty, in particular what they see as an attack on concessionary pricing for the young and old. For all but one of the nine –Tottenham– matchday revenue increased in 2023-24 compared to the previous season. Ticket pricing is only one factor of course – increasing ground capacity is another way clubs can generate more income, plus longer runs in domestic and European competitions. Prices are on the rise, though, with Premier League data from November last year showing the average ticket price in the top flight was now £38 across season tickets and general sale, up 18.75 per cent from where prices were prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Football Supporters’ Association said in a statement to the PA news agency: “Looking back to Covid when stadiums were closed to fans, we often heard that ‘football was nothing without fans’ thanks to the noise and atmosphere we generate. Football in an empty stadium isn’t the same. “Almost five years later it does feel like that lesson has been forgotten as almost every top-flight club bumped up prices last season, concessions for young and old fans are under attack, and the Premier League’s own data shows prices have jumped 19 per cent since 2020.” Real Madridwere the only club to see a sharper rise in matchday income than England’s top-20 representatives, and that can be attributed to the completion of renovation work at the Bernabeu stadium. The next four biggest percentage increases after that were seen at English clubs. Matchday revenues could be expected to rise sharply again for the current campaign, the first since the expansion of UEFA’s men’s club competitions. Tim Bridge, the lead partner in the Deloitte Sports Business Group, said: “As competitions expand and create more broadcast and matchday opportunities, these can further increase the earning potential for clubs. “At a time where there is more demand than ever for a greater number of matchdays, this must be balanced with player welfare, as they ultimately bring the on-field success that can earn clubs many further rewards off-field.” Real Madrid remain top of the Money League and became the first club to top one billion euros in revenue for a single season. Manchester Citystayed second, withManchester Unitedup one place to fourth.Arsenalare seventh,Liverpooleighth,Tottenhamninth,Chelsea10th, Newcastle 15th,West Ham17th and new entrantsAston Villa18th."
1/22/2025,12:22,Van Dijk says praise from opponents shows Liverpool ‘on the right track’,"CaptainVirgil van Dijkthinks the praise being lavished on Liverpool as the best team in Europe is merely a validation for the way head coach Arne Slot has them playing and no-one is believing the general hype. For the second successive match the opposition manager – on this occasion Lille’s Bruno Genesio after their 2-1 defeat at Anfield – said the Reds were the benchmark other teams should aspire to. After a seventh successive Champions League victory left Liverpool needing a point at most from their final game to guarantee top spot in the table, having already secured a place in the last 16, it is not the wildest take to label the Premier League leaders the best right now. “I think it sort of gives confirmation we are on the right track,” said Van Dijk. “We work in every game so hard to be a very difficult team to beat. When other managers are giving you praise for not only the way you attack, but defend as well as a group, and the bodies you get back behind the ball that is only a good sign and credit to all the hard work each and every one has been putting in. “That’s the only thing we should take from it and other than that it is just focusing on doing it and staying consistent.”"

The 25-year-old has 18 months left on his current deal but talks over a new contract, which he has yet to sign, were initiated by the league leaders in September. Earlier on Monday, Konate publicly said for the first time he has been offered a new deal - but added ""this is another conversation"" when asked whether he was close to signing. Sources close to Konate believe the consistency of his performances, the “gold-standard partnership” withVirgil van Dijk, his status in the squad underArne Slot, as well as literally putting his body on the line for the club, should be reflected in how well he is rewarded. The defender, who has worn the captain’s armband for France, is also seen as a player that has the capabilities to skipper Liverpool in future. Konate thus has a strong negotiating hand and the club are in a difficult position with renewals as none of Van Dijk,Mohamed SalahorTrent Alexander-Arnoldhave agreed new deals and can leave as free agents at the end of the season. If any of them recommit, it could offer guidance as to whether Liverpool’s highest bracket of wage has increased, which would then have a trickle-down effect."

1/18/2025,19:10,Slot says Liverpool players proved him wrong with late win at Brentford,"Arne Slotsays hisLiverpoolplayers “proved him wrong” after Darwin Nunez’s stoppage-time double gave the Premier League leaders a precious 2-0 win at Brentford. Nunez came off the bench to convert Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross before he finished off a counter attack two minutes later. Slot’s men had 37 shots in west London but were facing a third match without a win before the Uruguayan’s dramatic late salvo. Following successive draws against Manchester United and Nottingham Forest, it was an important three points for Liverpool in their quest for a second Premier League title. “Of course I had doubts about it,” Slot said when asked was worried about his side failing to find a winner. “Before we scored the two goals it was like I was watching the same game again (as draws against United and Forest). “So many times in recent weeks we’ve missed a lot of chances. It would have been surprising if I felt that after all the chances missed today that we’d score in the last five minutes. The players proved me wrong again. “Brentford have never conceded 37 shots in a game this season so what more can I ask from my players? They gave everything they had.”"
1/18/2025,18:19,Strength in depth key for Liverpool's title challenge,"Sky Sports' Oliver Yew at the Gtech Community Stadium: For long periods, it looked like it wasn't going to be Liverpool's day. Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold didn't have their shooting boots as the ball continued to flash wide of the target. Darwin Nunez - the hero of the hour for Liverpool - planted a free header wide from Andy Robertson's cross before blasting a terrible effort over the crossbar from 30 yards as it looked like the Reds were heading for a third straight league draw to start 2025 and more dropped points in the race for the Premier League title race. But Nunez and Liverpool eventually came good, and it is Arne Slot's ability to be able to empty Liverpool's bench with fresh attacking options that could be critical in their bid to. Liverpool, who were even without the injured Diogo Jota, racked up an incredible 37 shots at Brentford - a record for an away side in the Premier League - but it was their ability to sustain that pressure with fresh legs that eventually got them over the line. It was Nunez who came to the rescue on this occasion but Harvey Elliott, who has not had as many minutes as he would have liked this season, also played a key role from the bench with an assist for the second. If Mo Salah, Luis Diaz and Cody Gakpo don't get you, Darwin Nunez, Federico Chiesa and Harvey Elliott will! And when other sides in the league are struggling with injuries and depleted squads, that depth could be the crucial factor in Liverpool's bid to bring the title back to Anfield."
1/18/2025,18:17,Slot: I don't agree with critics - Nunez having good season,"Arne SlotsinsistsDarwin Nunezis having a good season after the striker scored twice as a second-half substitute to earnLiverpoola 2-0 victory at Brentford. Nunez had only netted twice in the Premier League this term before his double at the Gtech Community Stadium having been used sparingly, starting only seven times. “One of you asked me similar things before the game about Darwin and I didn't agree then that he's not having a good season,” said Slot. “I think he's having a good season. He scores goals, he works very hard for the team, he assists. “But he's in competition with a lot of good players. So that's why he's not every single game on the pitch. But I'm very happy with him, not only because he scored two goals today, that of course helps, but I'm very happy with the other performances he put in for us as well. “But if it's about strikers or if it's about the team, if we would not have scored today in the last five minutes, then the headlines would have been 'Liverpool drops points again'. No one would have told you 37 shots on target - what a display. “How many teams were able against Brentford to have 37 shots on target during a game? Now, because of our scoring too, probably there's a bit of emphasis on that fact as well. “This is the industry we work in, as a manager, the team, the players, we all accept this and we all understand this, that there's a lot of focus on if it doesn't go well and not as much on the fact if you have a great performance. “We are an industry where it's about winning and losing and not about if you play beautiful football. People only enjoy good football, beautiful football, if you win, otherwise there's no focus at all on the performance.”"

""Yesterday [Thursday] we were told at training that he was indoors doing an individual session [as is often the case as they manage individual workloads], but it turns out he picked up a niggle after his first touch rescued a point for Liverpool at Forest, and clearly they aren’t going to take any risks. ""Jota’s importance is highlighted by the importance of his goals….the winner against Palace, the equalisers against Fulham and Forest make up three of his last four Premier League goals. How crucial could those five points be in the title race come May? ""In terms of options to face Brentford, It’s not a desperate situation asLuis Diazcan play through the middle and Darwin Nunez is back from suspension. ""But Slot does want to see his side making the most of the big chances they are creating. After five goals in his previous four games, Mo Salah hasn’t scored in his last two [his second-longest run without a goal this season after going three games without a goal from mid to late September]. ""Cody Gakpo hasn’t scored in his last two after scoring in three on the bounce; Diaz has gone three games without a goal, while Nunez has hit just one in his last 12 appearances. ""Maybe this wouldn’t be highlighted if Liverpool were keeping clean sheets as regularly as they were earlier this season….they didn’t concede in 11 of their first 20 games in all competitions. However, since the 2-0 win over Manchester City, they’ve kept just three clean sheets in 11, conceding 14 goals. ""So, room for improvement at both ends of the pitch if Liverpool are to stretch their advantage to seven points before Arsenal take on Aston Villa live onSaturday Night Football."""

1/17/2025,11:00,Slot happy to see Liverpool competing with big spenders,"Liverpoolhead coachArne Slotis happy he has a team which can compete with bigger-spending Premier League rivals. The nine-and-a-half-year contract Erling Haaland signed with Manchester City on Friday, which is reported to be worth £500,000 a week to the Norway striker, was a reminder of the financial power a select number of top-flight clubs have. Sky Sports It sits in stark contrast to Liverpool’s current situation with three of their top stars Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold out of contract in the summer. Their combined weekly wage is estimated at £750,000, with Salah the highest earner in the club’s history with a weekly pay packet of £350,000. And while City are pushing through a January mini-rebuild with the signing of at least four players which could exceed £150m, the likelihood Liverpool will make a significant move remains slim. Asked whether City’s financial power meant his Premier League leaders cannot afford to drop their own high level of performance, Slot said: “Not particularly about the investment but we know how good we have to be every single day to compete in this league. “It is not only the club you are referring to, Chelsea also spend £1.2 billion, [Manchester] United spends an incredible amount. “Every team spends a lot of money over here, that’s why it’s such an interesting league to be part of. “Some season this club spends a bit more, other seasons other clubs spend a bit more. That’s what makes this league so intense and so difficult to win. “But that’s also the reason why we want to be here: you want to compete against the best, with the best, and we are very happy with the team we have at the moment and we are still able to compete with all the teams that are spending incredible amounts of money.”"

The Saudis tried 18 months ago to sign Salah. ""Al Ittihad made a bid that was supposed to be worth up to £150m but that was rejected and Salah decided to stay at Liverpool. They've always been very careful since then about making another move for Salah. ""What we've consistently been told is if Salah wants to go to Saudi Arabia, his representatives need to get in touch and they will make it happen. They would love to have Salah playing in the Saudi Pro League. ""Al Hilal, who are the champions and biggest club at the moment, have Neymar who is out of contract at the end of the season.

The Saudi champions are looking for a high-profile signing to replace Neymar. Neymar’s contract runs out at the end of this season and Al Hilal can offer to make Salah one of the star names at the expanded Club World Cup in the USA in June and July. Salah will be a free agent this summer and he has been free to talk to foreign clubs since the start of this month. Liverpool rejected a £150m offer for Salah from Al Ittihad in August 2023. Salah, who will be 33 in June, believes he is still at his peak and can continue to play at the highest level in Europe. In an interview withSky Sportstwo weeks ago, Salah said he expects this to be his final season at Liverpool. One of the most powerful figures in Saudi sport, Turki Alalshikh, posted a mocked-up picture on Facebook yesterday of Salah in an Al Hilal shirt. Alalshikh is the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s General Entertainment Authority and he is close to the kingdom’s de-facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

On the instant impact of Jota, who had only been on the pitch for 22 seconds when he headed in Tsimikas' corner, he said: ""We were a bit lucky with the goal because we took Ibou [Konate] out, who is normally a big threat from set-pieces, but we all know Jota can score a goal and Kostas has a good set-piece."" He was frustrated by perceived time-wasting by Forest. ""Us being one-nil down or one-one - that is always the main reason to be frustrated,"" he said. ""Then you want as much playing time as possible because the team happy with the current result wants as little playing time as possible. ""There were some moments where they went to the floor, there was not a head injury, and the referee blows his whistle but there's not even treatment.

However, four months on and Nuno Espirito Santo’s Forest are level on points with second-placed Arsenal, having won more matches than any other team except leaders Liverpool. “For us to lose on that day was, for me, hard to take,” said Slot ahead of Tuesday’s trip to the City Ground. “Now, looking back at it and seeing where they are in the league, it has not been such a shock result as I thought it was back then.” Slot admits Forest’s team selection surprised him that day but is not expecting to be confounded this time around. “I watched it back because I wanted to see what we did back then in terms of tactics and what we could do now,” he added. “Back then it was a surprise for us that Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga were not playing but they are playing so well now it again would be a surprise if they don’t start. “We are prepared for both but that we have to do better than that game, that is clear.”"

There were a few moments where the fans could see why we think he’s a talent. He’s really good in one-v-one situations and can change direction really fast.

A nice and special day for him."" On Trent Alexander-Arnold being player of the match:""Yeah – not for the first time I would say. He did not have his best game against Manchester United and everybody fell over him. At least it seems like that. But for the rest of the season, he’s been so good for us.

It questioned why the Liverpool defender would ever want to leave. His strike into the top corner showed what big a talent he is. He ran the game, albeit against weakened opposition, but him being a cut of class above the rest showed how rare a talent he is. And Arne Slot knows it – and sent Alexander-Arnold – into the final six months of his Liverpool deal - a message before kick-off. The Dutch manager started Rio Ngumoha, who became Liverpool’s second-youngest ever player on Saturday, who just weeks ago spoke about his own personal ambition to win the Ballon D’Or – an aim Alexander-Arnold revealed was on his bucket list. “He is at a club where players can win the Ballon d'Or. Let's wait but it's far too early to talk about that!” said Slot before the game. Ngumoha benefited from the freedom handed to him – he made more one-on-ones than anyone else and freeing up space for Kostas Tsimikas to create four chances – the most from the opening 45 minutes. Inverting inside and adored by the home crowd, Alexander-Arnold must remember the freedom and love he has at Liverpool, before he makes a career-defining decision."

Speaking toITV Sport,Liverpool manager Arne Slot said: ""It is special when young players make their debut. He is a young kid still and mostly trains with U21s and sometimes he works with us.

1/10/2025,10:43,Slot: Chiesa still has a part to play for Liverpool this season,"Liverpoolhead coach Arne Slot believesFederico Chiesahas to meet the challenge posed by the forwards currently ahead of him and show his worth to the side in the second half of the season. The Italian is set for only his fifth appearance of the campaign, having started just once and not played in the Premier League since September, in the FA Cup third round tie at home to Accrington. Chiesa, who has been on the bench for five of the last seven games, has struggled from not having a pre-season with Juventus ahead of his £10 million move to Anfield in late August. Sky Sports “It’s not only been difficult for him in terms of match fitness, it’s also that he has to compete with the likes of Cody Gakpo, Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota, Darwin Nunez and Mo Salah,” said Slot. “Everybody here knows the numbers Mo Salah brings in. There’s not many times a reason to take him out during a game or before a game. “It’s not only about Federico when we are talking about him being limited in his playing time. It’s also about the others. “But in terms of Federico it definitely has to do with the way he came in, the rest were already training a lot and we had to bring him up in terms of match fitness. “It’s a combination of reasons why he didn’t play that much yet but let’s wait and see in the upcoming weeks and months if he’s able to help us because the second half of the season is even more important than the first.”"

""If people ask me what we can improve, I say to win by bigger margins. We can't depend on little moments or luck, or bad luck. ""In football it's the same worldwide, you are only judged by the results. If you don't play well and win it's usually still viewed as positive. ""It's up to me to see if there is really so much difference between previous performances [against Tottenham and West Ham, where Liverpool scored a combined 11 goals] and recent ones."""

Stats show 44 per cent of opposition attacks come down the Liverpool right, compared to 32 per cent on the left. ""It might be true if you tell me,"" Slot said. ""It is more, but not by a mile. It could also mean that we attack more down the right and then they counter on that side if we lose the ball. ""If it's only 12 per cent, I don't see this as a problem. ""I do see a certain pattern in the goals we concede, but it's not about Trent [Alexander-Arnold], he had one difficult game for us [against Man United] - mainly he's played great games for us this season. ""I would like to highlight how well he did when he came on [against Tottenham] and how our fans reacted to him, that's what pleased me most."""

Speaking ahead of Liverpool's FA Cup meeting with Accrington Stanley, Slot told reporters ""almost all"" of the transfer talk is just gossip. ""I understand it's January, don't disappoint, please come up with these clubs where players will move,"" Slot said. ""Nine out of 10 times, almost all of these stories aren't true, they are rumours, keep going for it. ""But there will be no comments from my side."" Speaking specifically about Elliott, whose game time has been limited this season after injury, the manager said: ""He's talented, he's been this for so long. ""They are in competition with many other good players, he's been injured and out for a long time. ""In this league, with this tempo and intensity, it is not so easy to come back and be at your best.

Doolan was an academy coach at Anfield when he first spotted the talent of a six-year-old Alexander-Arnold, whose future at Liverpool has been the subject of intense speculation in the last fortnight. While he accepts Alexander-Arnold may have no recollection of him after nearly 20 years, Doolan is optimistic of catching up with the England full-back and his mother Diane when Accrington travel to Merseyside to take on the Premier League leaders on Saturday. ""I looked after Trent when he was six and seven, which he probably won't remember, but his mum, Diane, might, I spoke to her quite a lot,"" Doolan said. ""He was a centre-forward and you could see the ability he had then, scoring with both feet, could just glide past people. You could see he was an outstanding talent, even back then. ""When I moved on with my career, I ended up going back at some point and he was playing at centre-back, which I was surprised at. But he didn't look out of place playing centre-back. ""That's why he's now playing right-back and he's developed unbelievably. He's a world-class player. ""It would be nice if he does remember but it would be nice to see Diane and catch up with her as well."""

1/9/2025,12:55,Van Dijk: Pressure is constant at Liverpool,"Virgil van Dijk insisted Liverpool would not use Lucas Bergvall's contentious late winner for Tottenham as motivation ahead of next month's Carabao Cup semi-final second leg. Liverpool tasted defeat under Arne Slot for the first time since September on Wednesday after Bergvall fired home in the 86th minute to give Spurs a 1-0 victory, moments after he avoided a second yellow card for a late tackle on Kostas Tsimikas. Captain Van Dijk made his irritation clear to referee Stuart Attwell after Bergvall's challenge and at full-time, but played down suggestions the Premier League leaders would use that as fuel before Tottenham travel to Anfield on February 6 for the second leg. ""The frustration was purely on the pitch. After the game you can't do anything about it any more and unfortunately for us, it ended up with him scoring the winner,"" Van Dijk reflected. ""It doesn't work like that. We don't need that motivation. We know we will be 1-0 down when the game is played at Anfield so we have to fight. ""We have to do it all together, with our fans and the players. Obviously, hopefully everyone is fit and let's see if we can do it. ""It will be tough because they are a very good team in my opinion, with a very good manager but we're going to go for it. ""We're in a semi-final, we know how much they would like to win it but I know for a fact we would love to win it again and maybe even more."" Van Dijk claimed fatigue was not an issue and acknowledged further difficult moments would be on the horizon for a squad fully focused on Saturday's visit of Accrington, in the third round of the FA Cup. He added: ""I can only speak for myself and at the moment we are feeling fine (fitness-wise). ""We are going to have more difficult moments, that's a fact. We have been there before and that's the beauty of playing for Liverpool. Every game you play is difficult. ""The pressure is always on us as players because of the size of the club and everything we went through and it's a good thing. You have to embrace it and I'm really looking forward to the rest of the season."" Sky Sports"

""Everything has a price, the owners bought it for £300m and it is now valued at £5bn. He could easily afford that or even more than that. ""From a business point of view, it would be a no-brainer.

Last May, Forbes rated Liverpool the fourth most valuable club, with an estimated value of £4.3bn. However, that amounts to just over one per cent of Musk's total net worth, which is believed to be around £340bn. Musk snr said the interest was partly as there was a family connection to the city.

This is despite seeing two approaches already rejected by the Premier League leaders. Ipswich are also discussing internally whether to go back in for the winger, who is currently on loan at Middlesbrough, despite also being knocked back. Liverpool believe the first offers from both clubs fell far short of their valuation of Doak and they believe he can eventually play for their first team. They are also happy with his progress at Boro and would like to continue his development there. The Reds are in a strong position, with interest in Doak from a number of Premier League clubs and others in Europe. Therefore it would take a significant bid to tempt them to sell - probably with a buy-back option included in the contract. It is thought Palace are now considering offering a deal potentially worth over £20m for Doak, which would be closer to Liverpool's valuation of the player, it is believed.

The England international was at fault for Manchester United’s opener in the 2-2 draw at Anfield and was generally poor throughout, falling well below the high standards he has set himself. At the start of the week Real, with whom Alexander-Arnold has been strongly linked with his contract expiring in the summer, made an approach about the possibility of signing the 26-year-old in the current transfer window. They were immediately rebuffed and told the England international is not for sale in January but that and Alexander-Arnold’s subsequent display will be viewed as something more than a coincidence. However Van Dijk, who is another player whose current deal runs out in five months, has no concerns. “I am fine with it. Trent has his own people around him, his family and we are there as well,” he said. “He wants to perform in the best way possible like we all do.

""From a Trent Alexander-Arnold perspective, he would be completely naive to think that Liverpool are going to let him go mid-season because the message that would send to everybody would be wrong. ""From my point of view, Cara's just said about us being club men, I am a club man, I would never have left Manchester United, and I remember when Inter Milan were sort of coming in for Scholes and Giggs. ""They were never going to leave. But David Beckham, who was essentially a local kid, even though he came from London, he'd been at United since he was 13. His mum and dad adored United, they were season ticket holders and I never wanted him to leave. ""My advice to him was don't leave but he wanted to go and play for Real Madrid because he saw a journey that we didn't see. ""At the time I thought you might regret that. To be fair to him, he's gone and had the most incredible career and life at Real Madrid, and all those clubs beyond. ""When I look at Carra or Steven Gerrard, I went to famously, ask Steven Gerrard whether he'd make the short journey down the East Lancs Road to Manchester to come and play for United, and he said no. ""He said, I won't come and play for United because, to be fair, one, I don't want to, and secondly, to be fair, my family wouldn't ever be able to show up in Liverpool again. ""I look at Trent Alexander-Arnold, I don't see him quite the same as Carra or Steven Gerrard in the sense of I see him more like Michael Owen, and that's not a criticism, by the way. Someone who feels that their profile, their talent and their life needs something different. ""I look at Trent and I don't think he can lose here in the sense that you stay at Liverpool, you'll be a Liverpool legend and you'll be loved forever by the people here, and that's one way to go. ""I might be saying this completely differently about a United player, but when I look at the David Beckham factor, I think of Trent and the journey that Beck's had by going to Real Madrid, AC Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and Los Angeles, all those things that he's done in his life that I've not done. ""I don't ever regret what I did, but I also look at what he did. I speak to Roy Keane sometimes, and Roy could have gone to Juventus and Bayern Munich, and you've heard him say, I just wonder what it would have been like to play for these great clubs in Germany and Italy. ""So, I'm not saying he's got to stay, but on the other hand, if Real Madrid come in for you and he wants to do that in his life, then obviously that's the problem that I think Liverpool fans have at this moment in time, because this is a very passionate city, as is Manchester. ""They love their football club, he's one of their own, and it's tough, it's different for him than it is for Mo Salah and Van Dijk because he is a Liverpool boy."""
1/6/2025,08:24,Carra on Trent knowing about the Real bid…,"Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, Jamie Carragher said: ""Real Madrid have done this for a long time. You go back to Ronaldo, they are the biggest club in the world, and they've got their own media out there in terms of the papers they've got. ""In terms of the bid, I don't think they're going to bid that much more than that. ""My problem with it is, they have bid on the back of Trent Alexander-Arnold or his agent saying, put a bid in because they wouldn't put a bid in unless they get the say-so. ""But all those parties know, Liverpool are going to turn that down anyway. What are you trying to create? ""Liverpool are not going to sell Trent in January to go for a league title. ""Let's not be naïve here, no-one puts bids in now unless they've already spoken to the player about if they get accepted, would you come? People know before they put things in and there's obviously been talks. ""I've got no problem with that, that's the nature of the game. I'm sure he's in talks with Real Madrid and maybe other clubs, and maybe he's got a decision to make, but I think for that to come out when it did, I was not happy about that at all. ""We're probably not the best people to speak to about this because we've never been involved in a transfer and we're probably two of the biggest club men you could see. ""We'd always put the club first, but I just think the situation Liverpool are in, there's no way an agent or Trent Alexander-Arnold don't know that bid's going in before it goes in, and if you don't want that to go in, you say no."""
1/6/2025,08:23,Neville and Carra debate Real distraction as Slot defends 'poor' TAA,"Trent Alexander-Arnold's shaky performance against Manchester United was affected by suggestions of a recent bid from Real Madrid, says Jamie Carragher. The Liverpool right-back, having been heavily linked with Real this week, had a game to forget as United frustrated the Premier League leaders with a battling2-2 display at Anfield on Super Sunday. Alexander-Arnold, now in the final six months of his contract at his boyhood club, struggled to impose himself and was at fault for the visitors' first goal. Sky Sports"
1/6/2025,07:14,Slot backs TAA but accepts others will blame Madrid link,"Arne Slotconceded people will thinkTrent Alexander-Arnold’s performance was affected by rumours surrounding his future in title-chasing Liverpool’s 2-2 draw with Manchester United. The Liverpool right-back, having been heavily linked with Real Madrid this week, had a game to forget as United frustrated the Premier League leaders with a battling display at Anfield on Sunday. Alexander-Arnold, now in the final six months of his contract at his boyhood club, struggled to impose himself and was at fault for the visitors’ first goal. He was later booked and substituted off. Reds manager Slot does not believe the speculation had a big impact, but accepts other people will view the matter differently. The Dutchman said: “I think nine out of 10 people will tell you that it affected him. I’m (the) one of the 10 that tells you that I don’t think that affected him. “What affected him is that he had to play against Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot, two starters for Portugal, great, great players. “If these players set themselves to a game – and that is what United once in a while does – then it’s very difficult to play against them. “I think that is more difficult for Trent to play against than the rumours that were there during the week. “But that’s my opinion, and probably everybody’s going to tell you that it had to do with the rumours.”"
1/5/2025,22:44,Do Liverpool have a right-sided problem?,"Sky Sports' Laura Hunter: ""Second-half improvements have been a characteristic of Liverpool’s Premier League title charge this season. They have recovered 13 points from losing positions, trailing in four of their last six. Many would characterise such resilience as a necessary ingredient of any title hopeful, but their slow starts in games have also exposed a weakness. ""Three teams have given the league leaders a run for their money at Anfield this season - Nottingham Forest, Fulham and now Man United - and all left with points having scored the first goal. Powers of recovery can only carry you so far across a 38-game season. ""Man United played on the same frailty Forest and Fulham did - a gaping right-hand side - and got their rewards. 53.8 per cent of United’s attacks came down their left, targeting the space left by Trent Alexander-Arnold's predisposition upfield. ""Arne Slot's side have exhibited very few flaws this season, but that one has cost on more than one occasion."""

""That also happened last season going into the game and it finished 0-0. Jurgen Klopp was frustrated with the Liverpool supporters last season and everyone was sort of downbeat about it finishing 0-09. ""It’s a lesson because in the first half it felt like the players were like that. It felt like the atmosphere was like that and it wasn’t until Liverpool went behind that I felt like I was at Anfield watching Liverpool vs Man Utd. ""I think subconsciously, the players and everyone around Liverpool got carried away with how poor Man Utd were on Monday night. ""Anfield at its best is when it is energetic, and Liverpool are picking balls up. In the first half, I think there was one time Liverpool won the ball back and went quick, getting the crowd up. I always felt Liverpool were a yard shot. ""Definitely, this manager’s style is different to that of Klopp. There’s a little bit of that in it because it is not so gung-ho and going after teams. It’s about trying to get a bit more balance. ""That has helped Liverpool defensively but the big worry for me now is Liverpool are starting to concede goals. ""I still think Liverpool are the best team in this league, I still think they have a lot more goals in the team and more attacking talent than Arsenal, but if you were Arsenal watching that, the thing that will give you a little lift is Liverpool not winning, but also the fact they are starting to concede goals and chances."""

The game couldn't have gone much worse for him, there was always going to be focus on him. ""I was expecting him to put in a performance he has put in so often where he dominates the game from right-back. He's a playmaker. I felt Man Utd's system would play into his hands, there'd be a lot of space to get his head up and put crosses in. ""I thought he'd be thinking about how everyone's talking about him negatively, and that he'd put in a really big performance. He was poor defensively, but there was nothing going forward on the ball. ""Only he knows if the talk affected him, but the fact he was so poor in the first game after Real Madrid put a bid in tells me it must have affected him."""

""The Russian leagues were expanding, there were a lot of new players coming and a lot of agents, scouts were coming to watch the games,"" Vidic said. ""Anything, in life when people start speaking good about you, a lot of people find the interest. ""I had interest from Fiorentina, I had agreed a deal to go there - then came Liverpool.

1/3/2025,20:18,'Alexander-Arnold holds the cards over his Liverpool future',"Sky Sports News' Dharmesh Sheth speaking on the Transfer Talk Podcast: “When you compareSalahandTrent Alexander-Arnold,Real Madridhave actually approachedLiverpool. We can't be naive here; Real Madrid aren't going to approach Liverpool if they aren't getting any kind of encouragement that Alexander-Arnold at some point will want to join Real Madrid. “Liverpool are clearly not going to allow him to leave in this transfer window. And they're in a bit of a situation here, because with these three players, in particular Alexander-Arnold, and the amount of time that they've got left on their contracts, they hold all the cards here. They hold all the power. They know that they can effectively bounce one club off another. “I know Alexander-Arnold in his celebrations has suggested everyone's talking too much, miming with his hands that there's been too much chat about his future. But the fact of the matter is, for Real Madrid to actually approach Liverpool - and I know it got rebuffed - there must have been some encouragement that, at some point, Alexander-Arnold and his camp might have given an encouragement to Real Madrid that, yes, they would want to join. “On the flip side, it works brilliantly for Alexander-Arnold as well because, if you've got Real Madrid coming to Liverpool, and saying, ‘We want to bring in Trent Alexander-Arnold - what are the chances in this month?’ it might put Liverpool in a position realising we're going to need maybe to raise our offer to Alexander-Arnold. From everything that you can see on that situation, he holds all of the cards here. “I'm not saying he won't stay at Liverpool, I'm not saying he won't sign a contract at Liverpool, I just feel that the direction of travel for this one appears to be a move to Real Madrid on a free transfer come the summer.”"
1/3/2025,19:46,'Little noise about Salah signing a pre-contract elsewhere - do clubs expect him to stay at Liverpool?,"Sky Sports News' Dharmesh Sheth, speaking on the Transfer Talk podcast: “We don't exactly know what Mohamed Salah wants, be it a financial issue or a contract-length issue, but clearly that hasn't been agreed yet. We do know talks are ongoing, because even by saying that there's been no progress, the fact is that the two parties are talking to each other. “The one thing that keeps leading me to believe that Salah will be staying at Liverpool and it will eventually get resolved is he's now free to talk to clubs outside England ahead of a pre-contract agreement - I haven't really heard of any clubs that have gone to Liverpool. ""There hasn't been any noises about it, about clubs saying ‘We want to bring in Salah, we want to sign Salah now, or sign him on a pre-contract agreement’. ""Is that because, one, they're not interested? I couldn't believe that in a million years. Or is the message that these clubs are getting that he's going to end up staying at Liverpool? That seems to be what I feel the mood music is like. Sky Sports “Then again, you can take it on face value as well, and if you believe everything that Salah is saying just now, it's clear the contract hasn't been agreed because there's been no announcement, and he is saying that it's his last year, his last few months at the club, because there hasn't been an agreement. “There can still, of course, be that agreement, and it's not like it's affecting him at all, is it? He's been absolutely sensational for Liverpool this season. He seems to be spearheading them towards a Premier League title. “That is what I'm getting from all of this messaging. It's almost like saying to Liverpool, get a move on. It's encouraging the fans as well. You see it all over social media where they are saying to the club to just give him what he wants. “Liverpool can't just give him what he wants because there are other issues they have to deal with as well, not least what they'd have to pay other players who would be coming towards the end of their contract as well. Clearly, we haven't heard the last of it, but clearly, it's not affecting his form.”"
1/3/2025,18:46,Jones Knows: United worth a tickle at 8/1,"Sky Sports Sky Sports' betting expert Lewis Jones: Liverpool are likely to overwhelm Manchester United at some point in the match but every team has it's price. And at 8/1 with Sky Bet, with Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte back to bolster up the middle of the pitch, United are just too big to pass up, especially in a season where we've become accustomed to expecting the unexpected. Yes, United have taken just seven points from eight Premier League games under Ruben Amorim - since he was appointed only Leicester (4) and Southampton (2) have taken less. But you only need to go back a couple of games to see encouraging underlying metrics - they did win the expected goals battle for five games in a row, including winning the actual game at Manchester City. This away trip is obviously a huge step-up on that but this United squad is packed full of big-game players that have won multiple trophies in their time. At the prices, they are worth a nibble to deliver."

1/3/2025,10:40,Slot: Trent Alexander-Arnold focused on Liverpool despite Real Madrid link,"Liverpoolhead coach Arne Slot insistsTrent Alexander-Arnoldis fully committed to the club in the wake ofReal Madrid’sapproach this week. However, when the Reds boss was offered the chance to state publicly the England international would not be sold in January, the Dutchman merely said he would be playing against Manchester United on Sunday. Slot, as the club’s first head coach rather than manager, has had responsibility for contract negotiations and transfers taken out of his hands and, as a result, has always refused to speak about them and defer to sporting director Richard Hughes. Privately, the club insist the 26-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer, is not for sale and when the Champions League holders made an enquiry a few days ago, it was immediately rebuffed with the message they had no intention of discussing it further. Slot remained guarded in his press conference, but confirmed he has spoken with Alexander-Arnold following the Real approach and does not believe it will have a destabilising effect. “I completely understand the question and why you ask it, but you already know the answer: these conversations I have never shared, not about Trent, not about any others, about what I talk to them about,” he said. “It was a conversation as many others we had, me and Trent, so let’s leave it at that. “I can tell you he is playing on Sunday and hopefully he brings the same performances as he brought in for the last half-year, because everybody saw how great a first half of the season he had, how much he is here, how much he wants to win here. “I see him on the training ground every day working his ass off. He is fully committed to us and he will play on Sunday. “If it would destabilise players at Liverpool if other people talk about them, then we would really have a problem because if you play at one of the biggest clubs in the world everybody is always – for 12 months long – talking about you, sometimes in relation to other clubs. “That happens so many times for our players, so if that destabilises them then we really would have had a problem, not only now but in the last six months because there were some talks about our players in the last six months and I don’t think it destabilised them at all.”"

When asked about January signings, Ancelotti told a press conference on Thursday: “It is difficult for me to talk about that in this context. But we are going to have to wait and see. “We are focused on all these games in January and the game tomorrow (against Valencia) and I’ve got nothing more to say.

I think that's a dream for probably 90 per cent of players around the world to play or end up at their final destination is Real Madrid or Barcelona. ""You see [Kylian] Mbappe and you see that with any player who is maybe rated as the best player in the world. They somehow end up playing for Real Madrid or Barcelona. ""I think with it being Trent and him playing for his local club, I think that makes it slightly different. Different if Trent was playing for Chelsea or Arsenal, he wasn't a London boy. I don't think there would be any question he would make that move. ""I think the fact that he would be leaving his club, that's he been at since the age of five or six, I think it makes it more of a decision than it just being Real Madrid.

The league said that would require clubs to “terminate contracts, sell players, or deregister squad members” in order to add new players in the winter window. “The SPL will work closely with clubs and the Financial Sustainability Committee to ensure compliance with league policies and regulations,” a league statement read.

Al Hilal chief executive Esteve Calzada said at Leaders Week London in October that his club had reached its limit on foreign signings, amid speculation linking the club with Salah. The Egyptian’s current deal with Liverpool ends in the summer, and he told Sky Sports on Sunday that a conclusion to his contract situation was still “far away”.

Slot was asked if this is the best version of Van Dijk Liverpool and world football are currently seeing. The Dutchman replied: ""I can only tell you what my experiences are with him, he’s been not only for what you see: he’s outstanding during the game, but he has such a big impact in training sessions as well. ""He’s the focal leader of this team, every time we start an exercise, every time he’s on top of his team-mates and he leads by example. ""For me, he’s been outstanding until now and we can only hope he continues showing this during the games and in training sessions as long as he’s with us."" Van Dijk is one of three key Liverpool players out of contract in June 2025, alongsideMohamed SalahandTrent Alexander-Arnold. From January 1, all three players can speak to clubs outside of England to negotiate pre-contract agreements - but Slots insists the situation with all three players will not change. ""If we would, now is probably not the moment for me to tell you now. But in general, I don’t talk about contract situations here. It would be a surprise if I was the one to announce that one of them had extended, that’s in a different moment. Keep asking because that’s your job but you’re not going to get an answer from me. ""It’s clear that from the January 1, maybe for you guys, things change a lot but they are in constant talks with the club. Let’s wait and see what happens, as long as they keep performing like this, the head coach is happy with them."""

Liverpool beat Leicester 3-1 to move seven points clear at the top of the table, in a season where they are also in the Carabao Cup semi-finals and also top of the Champions League. Jones, who scored on his 100th Liverpool game on Boxing Day, revealed he received a text from Klopp on the day of the game - and admitted it is a regular occurrence among the Reds squad. “100, on to the next 500. Congratulations my friend (and a picture of his little granddaughter),” said Jones to LFCTV about the text Klopp sent him. “He's been texting me loads since he has been gone. He is texting me all the time. That's what he is like with all the lads. “He is the man who made me from a kid to a man. There was always talks around me, 'is he good enough. He is always injured.' “There is a reason why I am here now still. That's because of him and the belief he had in me. “He is still in touch with the whole team. He is a great man he is loved of us. He set up the foundation for the team that we've got. Slot is just carrying it on.”"

We were threatening them for six minutes, but then one moment where we underestimated a situation and it immediately led to a chance and a goal and we have to work really hard to come back in the game. ""In the end I wouldn't say we were lucky, but it really helped to score before half-time, because we went 1-0 down and it was a game before we made it 3-1. Then I think you saw how good we really are."""

12/26/2024,22:26,Analysis: Is there any stopping Liverpool?,"Sky Sports' Nick Wright: By the time the final whistle sounded at Anfield, Jordan Ayew's opening goal felt like a distant memory. Remarkably, Leicester did not have a single shot after the 10th minute of the game. Such is Liverpool's capacity to smother their opponents. They stayed cool after falling behind, even as they struggled to find their rhythm. But Mo Salah is not their only game-changer. Cody Gakpo is another. His equalising goal was a thing of beauty and the result never looked in doubt after that. Liverpool were ahead soon after half-time and, of course, Salah had to get his goal too. In the end, it felt like as easy a victory as Liverpool could have asked for. It is coming up to four months since they last lost a game. That September reverse against Nottingham Forest looks more and more like an aberration. The recent draws against Newcastle and Fulham felt uncharacteristic too but Liverpool are back in their flow now. Their unbeaten run now stands at 22 games in all competitions. They will be top at the turn of the year, regardless of the result against West Ham on Sunday. They will most likely be top in May too. It is becoming difficult to see any other outcome. Sky Sports"

The Dutchman is one of three key Liverpool players - along withMohamed SalahandTrent Alexander-Arnold- whose contracts expire at the end of the season. The trio of players, however, are allowed to negotiate with foreign clubs from January 1 over a free transfer in the summer. But while rumours continue to circulate, Van Dijk has declared his ""love"" for the club. The 33-year-old toldAmazon Prime:  “I love the club, the club loves me. ""I love the fans, the fans love me and it is a very good foundation to be successful. ""In my opinion I can play for another three, four years at least at the highest level.

As manager of Feyenoord, Slot drew and lost to the former Manchester United striker, who was boss of PSV Eindhoven for just over a year, but had the last laugh as his team finished seven points clear in winning the Eredivisie title. “I was expecting you to tell the people over here that I lost once and drew once, but you made it positive saying we won the league title, which was true,” said Slot when his title win was highlighted. “Cody Gakpo was in his team, so I am happy he is in my team now when we face Ruud because Cody scored (in a 4-3 victory). “Ruud is a very nice person first of all. I met him once or twice and he did really well when he was at PSV because PSV for the last one-and-a-half years they have been on top of the league table. “But if you look at the second half of Ruud’s season, they didn’t even lose any more at all. “After he left they started buying a few more players than they did when he was working there but he still showed he can compete for the title. “He did well at United as well and I am looking forward to seeing him, especially if we win.”"

This is the 21st time Liverpool have been top on Christmas Day, the most of any side, with the Reds going on to lift the title in 11 of those previous 20 seasons. The Liverpool boss tellsSky Sportsabout the difficulty of becoming champions - having won the Eredivisie with Feyenoord in his final season in charge - and needing to enjoy the process to have any chance of success. ""The best way to judge the league table is after 19 games,"" he says. ""It's so hard to win a league, everywhere around the world. You have to do so many things well, that's why not many teams and not many players are able to do so. ""I hope I can continue to be so happy with the work I do. We are in this job [to win], but it's a long process and you have to do many, many things right. ""You have to enjoy that process as well, and that's what I've done over the past year and I hope to do in the upcoming year."""

The Dutchman joined Liverpool two years ago following stellar performances at the World Cup, and he expressed his hope to stay at the club for “many more years”. “I enjoy every minute I’m here,” the 25-year-old said. “It has been a fantastic two years for myself. A lot of things happened obviously – a lot of good moments, some less good moments but a lot of things that I’ve learned. “I’m very happy to be here at the club, hopefully for many more years. I think now we are in a good place as a team and I’m very happy that I can contribute as well.” Boxing Day will bring a reunion for Gakpo with new Leicester boss Ruud van Nistelrooy, who he worked with at PSV Eindhoven. Having begun his tenure with victory over West Ham, Van Nistelrooy has been quickly brought down to earth by back-to-back defeats against Newcastle and Wolves in which his team have conceded seven goals and scored none. “He was the striker coach for me when I was in the first team a little bit and also when I was in the academy,” Gakpo said of his time at PSV. “I learned a lot from him and I’m very grateful for all the lessons. He was also my head coach in the last half-season I was at PSV, so very grateful for all the lessons he taught me and it was an honour to get all those teachings from him.”"

The 32-year-old Egypt forward is out of contract at the end of the season and a new deal is yet to be agreed. Salah has been in sensational form so far this season and the two goals he scored against Tottenham on Sunday took him above Billy Liddell into fourth place on Liverpool’s list of all-time leading goalscorers. “It’s very special what we are all witnessing,” winger Gakpo told the club’s website. “The amount of goals he scores but the assists he gives as well, the way he plays the game, how he puts other attacking players or midfielders like myself in a position to score and to be dangerous is from a high level. “I hope for us and for him that he can continue doing that for a long time. We are very lucky to have him and proud that we can be his team-mate and try to make him better. And he is trying to make us better as well.”"

The Netherlands international’s current deal expires in the summer and from next week he would be able to negotiate with overseas clubs about moving at the end of the season. However, it is understood the 33-year-old’s preference is to stay at Anfield and the player himself is just concentrating on a campaign which has them top of the Premier League and Champions League tables. “There is no deadline at all.

Van Dijk said following the 6-3 win at Tottenham: ""Are you speaking about a quadruple in this case? Well, I think I've given answers already many times that we don't think what's out there in May. We want to be up there in May, but we've seen how difficult it is. ""But, listen, we focus about what's next ahead of us and that's the only thing. I'm not getting dragged into any conversation about potential winning a trophy or two or three or four. ""It's all about being there each and every game that's ahead of us. At the moment, there was Spurs today, a tough one, but we made a very good game. And then next is Leicester, and that's the only team we have influence on as well."" After Liverpool's big win over Tottenham, Van Dijk said he is not surprised by the team's success and the position they find themselves in this season. ""No [we've not surprised ourselves]. Yeah, obviously, I think we have only had one addition made to the squad in terms of Federico (Chiesa), and this group of players have been playing together for quite a long time. ""The experience is there, the quality is there, I've seen it each and every day. It's obviously a surprise where it's such a big change happening with Jurgen (Klopp) being replaced by the new manager, and there will always be question marks, but I still had so much trust in my team that we could definitely be competing at the moment, in the top of the Premier League at least.

Those comments inevitably will raise questions about the long-term aspirations of the 26-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer and has been persistently been linked withReal Madrid- the home of regular Ballon d'Or winners. But Slot was happy for Alexander-Arnold to set his ambitions high, as long as they contributed to the success of the team. ""I definitely like this in a player. I think this is something every player must have if you play at this level, if you don't have this you probably don't play at this level ,"" said the Dutchman. ""As long as they understand that they need the team to be special as an individual. As long as they put the team first and as a result be special themselves, that is what they all do - including Trent.

Alexander-Arnold, whose expiring contract this summer is a cause for concern for his club, has won the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup [twice]. The England international was asked, on theMen in Blazers podcast, what else he would like to accomplish and he said: “Of course winning more trophies, but on a personal level, building a legacy, that is something that is important.

But with Liverpool top of the Premier League and the Champions League tables, and having captained the team in their Carabao Cup quarter-final win at Southampton on Wednesday in the absence of the rested Virgil van Dijk, there is still plenty to play for at Anfield.

Speaking onMonday Night Football, Carragher sympathised with the 30-year-old who has come under fire at times this season. He said he may have picked up a knock from an earlier challenge by Issa Diop - and might have been substituted if Liverpool had other options at the back. ""He’s having a tough time,"" he said. ""As a full-back, it’s an unforgiving position, you can get exposed at times. ""This is one of those decisions where it’s an orange card. He gets a yellow. When he’s running back here, he doesn’t look like he’s running back fully. ""It probably plays a part in what happens between the tackle and getting sent off. ""It’s just a nightmare day for him.

12/16/2024,12:44,Slot praises Liverpool players: I couldn’t have asked for more,"Arne Slotpraised his Liverpool players after they fought back to draw 2-2 with Fulham despite playing more than hour with ten men. “I think it is exactly the opposite from Girona [the midweek Champions League win] where I was pleased but not the performance,” he said. “Here I am very happy about the performance, I couldn’t have asked for more, but of course not with the result because if you drop points in a home game against Fulham that is definitely not what you expect and what you want. “But yeah, being a goal down twice, it’s all going against you, except for one thing, which is our players and our fans, I thought we were outstanding.”"
12/16/2024,12:41,Slot praises Robertson despite red card,"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot apportioned no blame to Andy Robertson for his early red card against Fulham in which his side twice came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw in a pulsating Anfield encounter. In fact, the Dutchman said the Scotland left-back epitomised the team’s fighting spirit having played on after a knee-high challenge from Issa Diop in the opening seconds which he felt compromised his ability. He was caught out for Andreas Pereira’s 11th-minute goal and his dismissal for bringing down Harry Wilson when through on goal left Liverpool, then already trailing 1-0, at a numerical disadvantage for more than 82 minutes (including the additional time). But Slot and the team’s positive approach salvaged an important point and extended their unbeaten run to 19 matches. Cody Gakpo equalised two minutes into the second half and Diogo Jota made it 2-2 with four minutes of normal time remaining after Rodrigo Muniz had put Fulham ahead for the second time. “The character the team showed, that is what Robbo showed,” said Slot. “If you get a kick like this, two studs on a knee, that can hurt for a few minutes. If you keep running and it gets better and better, that is what we were hoping for. “I only had one defender on the bench, who is not a left full-back, so you are hoping he was managing to come through it and did quite well. “But the moment I noticed he wasn’t completely himself was the one time they put the ball in behind and he started running and was just able to head back to Ali [Alisson Becker]. “I felt ‘Hmm, OK, let’s see how this continues’ and I think it was quite soon afterwards he conceded the red card. “Nothing to blame him, the character showed in wanting to continue because he got quite a hard knock with two studs. Unfortunately, it led to a deserved red card.”"
12/16/2024,12:33,Was Robertson unlucky to be sent off against Fulham?,"INCIDENT:Liverpool defender Andy Robertson is shown a straight red card after bringing down Harry Wilson and denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. DERMOT SAYS:""I have had a lot of chances to look at this again and I did not think it was a red card at the time, and I still do not. ""Robertson mis-controls the ball and Wilson nicks the ball. Is he in control of the ball? No. ""Is he going to gain control of the ball? Doubtful as the Liverpool player is going to get there first. Is he moving towards goal? No. there are too many variables and the 'O' stands for obvious. ""A more palatable decision would be a yellow card - if the ref [Tony Harrington] had whistled immediately, I think everybody would have accepted it."""
12/15/2024,17:05,Van Dijk hopes risk-taking is rewarded,"LiverpoolcaptainVirgil van Dijkadmits the potential rewards on offer this season mean it is worth taking risks when the situation demands. Many managers faced with the problem Arne Slot had of seeing Andy Robertson sent off after 17 minutes with the team 1-0 down at home to Fulham would have taken off a forward to restore the defence and then try to eke something out of the game late on. Slot, however, kept faith with the players on the field, briefly tinkering with the formation to operate with a back three with midfielder Ryan Gravenberch dropping back before settling on another reshuffle in reverting to a flat four with Joe Gomez on the right. From that point the Premier League leaders not only pushed for an equaliser but for the win, and they were rewarded with Cody Gakpo’s diving header just after half-time, only to fall behind again when Rodrigo Muniz scored. However, Slot continued to push and substitute Diogo Jota, returning after an 11-match absence, made it 2-2 in the 86th minute, but the hosts could not force a winner. “It’s a brave thing to do but it was the right thing to do because we have the quality to hurt opponents, even with 10 men and there was so much time left on the clock,” Van Dijk said. “It’s still a bit of a risk, but we got the rewards from it and that’s the main thing. “We don’t want to be in the situation where you take that much risk but if you are 1-0 down, 2-1 down you have to. “The will and the resilience was a good sign as it was a lot more difficult than it already was, but we had to keep going for ourselves and everyone connected with Liverpool. “We could have taken three points, if I’m absolutely honest, but it is what it is.”"
12/14/2024,19:04,HAVE YOUR SAY! Should Liverpool fans be worried after more dropped points?,"Liverpool dropped two more points in Saturday's 2-2 draw with high-flying Fulham at Anfield, the second Premier League match in a row that Arne Slot's side have been held after their 3-3 draw at Newcastle United. As a result, the Reds' lead at the top of the table has been whittled down to just two points, albeit with a game in hand on their rivals, meaning second-placed Chelsea can move above them and into top spot when they travel to Everton on Sunday, hours before Slot and co visit Tottenham, live onSky Sports.

The forward missed a couple of good openings in the Champions League win over Girona in midweek and has just three goals from 19 appearances this term. However, Slot believes Nunez is still contributing to his side. ""For me, he has impact,"" said Slot. ""If you only look at goals, he hasn't scored the amount he wants or we want a No9 to score. But he does have an impact with his work-rate and that's not only for the other team not to create a chance but if we lose the ball he's aggressive that we can get the ball back. ""He's part of a team that scores goals and is winning a lot but of course as a No9 you want to score goals and that's definitely what he wants as well. ""I'm not only judging Mo [Salah] on his goals and I'm not only judging Darwin on his goals, I also judge them on their work-rate and what they bring to the team and that has been positive until now. ""Maybe because the fans support him so much he wants it too much to score that goal for himself and the fans."" Slot added: ""It's the life of a No9, sometimes you score, sometimes you don't. But what should always be there is work-rate. That's what he had apart from two games. ""The first game against Las Palmas [in a friendly] and the last half-hour against Girona wasn't of the standards he should have and that had a lot to do with him being disappointed after missing a few chances."""

Jota has been out since October with a rib injury, while Chiesa has made just one Premier League appearance since joining on loan from Juventus in the summer. He has been out with illness following an injury. ""I think they are,"" said Slot when asked if the players are ready to be in the squad this weekend. ""We have one training session to go. Federico missed quite a lot for a long time, he was ill last week. We have to wait and see how he's doing. ""But maybe Diogo is in the squad and maybe Federico as well but that depends a bit on numbers and how he recovers from his illness."" Slot added: ""Chiesa needs playing time and if you haven't played for five or six months it is sometimes difficult for a manager because you don't know what to expect. Yes, I see him on the training ground, but ideally you see him in a friendly during the week or an U21 game. But that's not the situation we have. ""Maybe the Southampton game might be a good moment for him to get some playing minutes. We know his qualities but he needs to get his fitness level and training sessions are not the same as playing time."" Liverpool go to Southampton in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday."

12/11/2024,15:58,Nunez responds to criticism,"LiverpoolstrikerDarwin Nunezhas responded to more criticism of his form with a message of resilience. The Uruguay international cut a frustrated figure in Tuesday's 1-0 Champions League win inGironawith another ineffectual performance leading the line. Nunez has scored only one goal in his last 10 appearances and managed only three all season - fewer thanDiogo Jota, who has missed the last 11 matches with a chest injury. Jota's imminent return puts the 25-year-old's position in jeopardy, with even left-winger Luis Diaz being employed centrally on occasions, and sections of the fan-base are beginning to question the potential £85m club-record signing's value to the team after 36 goals in 115 appearances over two and a half years. In what appeared a response to the criticism, the Uruguayan wrote on an Instagram story: ""They are not all, they are some. Thank you Reds for your support, we are all still together."" In a separate post he just wrote the word ""Resiliencia (Resilience). On X he wrote: ""Together we stand, ready for what's next!"""

Head coach Arne Slot was unhappy with his side’s showing in Spain, despite the Reds securing a sixth win out of six to stay top of the Champions League table and on the verge of guaranteeing a place in the last 16 without the need for a play-off round. Slot felt his team lacked intensity, particularly in the first half when Alisson was called into action more times than he would have expected on his return to the side after an 11-match absence with a hamstring injury. “It’s part of (being) a winning team,” he told liverpoolfc.com. “You’ve seen so many teams during the season winning trophies and they don’t deliver the best performances ever. “Of course we are not machines and we are going to have not-so-good days, but the good thing in football is you have another chance in three days. “We just have to prepare ourselves (for Fulham on Saturday), don’t be upset and be happy for the points, but also have the acknowledgement that you have to improve. “It’s not something we have to make new, just look to the good things we did in the games against Manchester City and Real Madrid (both 2-0 victories), and keep on doing that. “Now having players coming back from injuries is good as well; myself, Diogo (Jota), (Federico) Chiesa.

I am far from pleased about the performance tonight.” Asked what had made him so unhappy he added: “A lot. Especially two things. “If you play against a team who has such a good idea about football and know how to bring the ball out from the back like some other teams we faced recently, like (Manchester) City or Real Madrid then you have to be so intense if you want to make it difficult for them. “But if every time you are waiting a few seconds and then if you do press, you are so easily out-played as this team can cause you problems and this is what they showed during the whole Champions League campaign, except for PSV Eindhoven away. “I almost feel sorry for them because they deserve so much more in this campaign than the three points they have now. “And every time we lost the ball we were not aggressive enough, almost every time they just went all the way to our goal. “We had hardly any control in the game, maybe the second half was better – I’m trying to be positive.”"

""Alisson has been out for a while so maybe we had to see whether he was rusty or not and he certainly wasn't!

The Egypt international became the 11th man to reach 50 Champions League goals, overtaking Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Kylian Mbappe with Thierry Henry (51) and Thomas Muller (54) now in his sights. Having missed from the spot a fortnight ago against Real Madrid, there was no mistake this time when presented with the opportunity in the 63rd minute to extend an impressive record of scoring in 11 of his last 16 matches. Sky Sports And while the chatter and conjecture over the summer expiration of his contract – reports last week suggest he has at least now been offered a new deal – it is not affecting the 32-year-old’s output. It was his 16th goal of the season, his 47th for the Reds in European club football’s premier competition, and Liverpool’s 50th. He also equalled Steven Gerrard’s club record of six Champions League penalties and is now just one goal behind Billy Liddell, fourth on the club’s all-time goalscoring list. Salah benefited from a VAR intervention after it spotted Luis Diaz’s left boot had been removed by former Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek’s ambitious attempt to nick the ball in the penalty area. But it was not only Salah’s reliability which Liverpool were indebted to as goalkeeper Alisson Becker, making his first appearance in two months after a hamstring injury, helped extended their run without conceding in this competition to just short of nine hours."

""I would have loved to have seen Darwin score because he needs a goal and that's why I kept him on the pitch for quite a long time. He was a threat but when a striker doesn't score you're always asking yourself whether it's a not good play or because of lacking confidence. ""Girona lost a lot of quality in the summer so to play like they do and give us, Feyenoord and PSV so much difficulty says a huge amount about them.

12/10/2024,08:14,Alisson returns to Liverpool squad for Girona Champions League clash,"GoalkeeperAlisson Beckerhas been named in Liverpool’s Champions League squad for their match in Girona. The Brazil international, 32, has been sidelined since October with a hamstring problem which has seen him miss 11 matches. Alisson and forwardDiogo Jota, who has not featured since sustaining a chest injury against Chelsea on October 20, were both involved in full training at Liverpool’s AXA training complex on Monday. However, only the goalkeeper has been included in the 19-man party which flew out to Spain from Merseyside for Tuesday evening’s game. Caoimhin Kelleher has kept five clean sheets, including two against Real Madrid and Manchester City, since he began covering for Alisson but made his first real error at Newcastle on Wednesday with his late misjudgement allowing the hosts to snatch a 3-3 draw. “So happy to be back,” Alisson posted on Instagram from on board the team plane before take-off. MidfielderAlexis Mac Allisteralso did not travel as he is suspended. But the return of Alisson and Jota is a boost for head coach Arne Slot ahead of the busy festive schedule to come. ForwardFederico Chiesa, whose own fitness struggles have limited him to three appearances since joining late in the summer, was not present at training due to illness. Chiesa, a £10 million signing from Juventus, scored for the U21s last week as he stepped up his recovery.

""Liverpool want to do right by the players, but right by the club too. It's been very apparent that Salah and Van Dijk want to stay. They've been unequivocal about that, and Salah's comments to the press actually underline that desire. ""He loves the city, his daughters go to school here. He doesn't want to change, he wants to be a Liverpool legend and continue to smash the records he's been setting. ""The contrast is with Alexander-Arnold, who has huge interest from Real Madrid. His comments about wanting to win the Ballon d'Or is very much singing from their hymnsheet - it's their sales pitch, to go and win it at their club. ""It might be a lot more expensive to get Alexander-Arnold's deal over the line. You get the sense that with Van Dijk and Salah wanting to stay, the club wanting to find a solution, there might be a lovely little Christmas present for Liverpool supporters - and that you might see Van Dijk in front of the Christmas tree again as a replica of when he first signed in December 2017."""

12/6/2024,14:41,Van Dijk: I really enjoy the responsibility of being Liverpool captain,"Virgil van Dijkadmits he enjoys the responsibility of beingLiverpoolcaptain and has set himself a high bar when it comes to the standards required to lead by example both on and off the pitch. The Dutchman has relished the responsibility of leadership since he first took the armband for Willem II’s under-19s team and it is no surprise he lists the likes of Roger Federer, LeBron James and Tom Brady as his inspiration. Those exacting principles mean even the slightest error will lead to him vowing to never make the same mistake again and it is why he is regarded as one of the best, potentially the best, centre-back of his generation. Praise has been flooding in for the Netherlands international all season but after his performance in last weekend’s win over Manchester City the plaudits escalated to another level. But while the outside noise grows over Liverpool’s title challenge and Van Dijk’s elevation to the ranks of one the best in Premier League history, the 33-year-old remains focused on driving himself and his team-mates forward. “I always had that responsibility feeling since a younger age,” he told the PA news agency at an event in Ronald McDonald House Alder Hey, which provides accommodation for families of children undergoing treatment at the Liverpool hospital and looking for donations for a new refurb. “I became a captain first for the under-19s at Willem II in my last season before I left there. Playing in the position I do you have to feel the responsibility. “I felt like I had it and I grew into it even more. I really enjoy it, it keeps me on my toes, it keeps me always ready to perform no matter what. “The expectation from everyone out there, including my team-mates, is also going to be high and that’s the standard I’ve set and I like it. “But I definitely keep myself to a higher standard, I always want to play my best game ever. That’s the aim. “A small error – not even being seen as an error but what I see as an error – can definitely be on my mind and then the next thought is ‘This will never happen again’ and I work on it and move on. “You have to set the right example, you have to lead by example, you have to find different solutions when you are under pressure.”"

The Reds ultimately left St James’ Park with only a point after Fabian Schar snatched a 3-3 draw at the end of a pulsating encounter, but Salah’s double – his 14th and 15th goals of the season – transformed a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 lead before the Switzerland defender’s late intervention. The 32-year-old Egypt international’s future at Anfield remains a topic of debate with his current contract running down. Asked about Salah’s future, Slot said: “It’s difficult for me to predict the long-term future, but the only thing I can expect or predict is that he is in a very good place at the moment. “He plays in a very good team that provides him with good opportunities and then he is able to do special things. “And what makes him for me even more special is that in the first hour or before we scored to make it 1-1, you thought, ‘He’s not playing his best game today’, and to then come up with a half-hour or 45 minutes – I don’t know how long it was – afterwards with an assist, two goals, having a shot on the bar, being a constant threat, that is something not many players can do if they’ve played the first hour like he did. “That is also what makes him special.

Arsenal are the closest challengers but even they have work to do after Arne Slot’s side won an 18th match out of 20 this term with a degree of comfort. Sky Sports"

Attention now turns to a thrilling contest with Manchester City at Anfield, live on Sky Sports at 4pm this Sunday, in which Liverpool could go 11 points above the reigning champions if they win. ""They are still being assessed, it’s difficult to see where they are in terms of the injury,"" said Slot of Konate and Bradley's fitness. ""Let’s wait and see, but it’s never a good sign.

11/26/2024,18:06,Slot admits Real Madrid carry Champions League aura,"Liverpoolhead coachArne SlotadmitsReal Madridcarry a different aura into Champions League matches than other clubs which can give them a psychological advantage. The Spanish club have become something of a nemesis for the Reds in recent years, beating them in the 2018 and 2022 finals in a sequence of eight matches in which they have won seven and drawn one. Liverpool’s last victory over Madrid came in March 2009 when Steven Gerrard (two), Fernando Torres and Andrea Dossena scored in a 4-0 victory. Slot is facing 15-time champions Real for the first time, as are number of the players who were not even at the club for their last meeting in 2023 when Liverpool led 2-0 after 14 minutes in the home leg of a last-16 first leg tie but went on to lose 5-2. Two of the four goals Liverpool have scored in the last eight meetings came in that match. Asked about whether Real have an advantage in that respect Slot said: “I think they might do. “I cannot talk for all the other teams they face but when I worked at my former club (Feyenoord) I said many times we should take the (example) of Madrid, that they always find a way to win. “They can win it in different ways and that is probably one of the reasons – apart from them having so much quality – that they won this tournament a lot. “I can only speak for myself but maybe the players feel the same. “They can win by being dominant and outplaying the opponent, but if it is a difficult game they always find a way to win the game or go to the next round. “If we are fortunate enough to be a goal up or even more up we still are aware of the fact, especially because of what we experienced two years ago, that the game will never be done until the referee blows his whistle. “In general it is like this but I think we all feel it against Real Madrid a bit more than some other clubs we face.”"

11/25/2024,13:33,Slot warns of challenges ahead for in-form Reds,"Arne Slot admitted it will be a challenge to replicate Liverpool’s stellar Premier League form in Europe as the season progresses, as they prepare to face Champions League holders Real Madrid at Anfield on Wednesday. Only three times in the Champions League era has an English team won the competition and the domestic league in the same season, though Slot’s side currently lead the way on both fronts. Sunday’s 3-2 comeback win at Southampton moved them eight points clear of champions Manchester City in the Premier League while they have a perfect record of four victories from four in Europe ahead of the visit of Real. But Slot warned the nature of the Premier League makes it tough for teams to maintain that kind of consistency – and that fans should not automatically expect his side to match the feat of Manchester United in 1999 and 2008 and City in 2023 by conquering England and Europe. “This league asks a lot from every player every weekend, and if you then play in Europe then it’s not always easy,” he said. “There’s only a few teams in England have shown they can do this, and Liverpool have shown it in the past for many seasons. It’s why teams in England have such a big squad. “You saw (against Southampton), the three players that came in really had an impact on the game and that is also what we need in this league.” Slot was wary of allowing his players to get carried away and pointed to similarly healthy advantages that have been squandered in previous seasons. “(In 2022/23), Arsenal led by eight points and City came back,” he said. “You know if you face City, Arsenal, Chelsea and these other teams; Tottenham were great (Saturday, beating City 4-0). “They’re all able to win so many games in a row. It’s nice to have this position but we’re definitely not getting carried away.” Only twice in the Premier League have teams taken 31 points from their first 12 games and failed to win the title – Newcastle in 1995/96 and Arsenal two seasons ago."

The Brazil forward played the whole match on Sunday as Real won 3-0 at Leganes in LaLiga but tests have revealed a leg issue and he has been left out of Carlo Ancelotti’s 19-man squad for the trip to Anfield. A statement from the club on Monday morning said: “Following tests carried out today by the Real Madrid medical services on our player Vini Jr, he has been diagnosed with an injury to the biceps femoris in his left leg. His progress will be monitored.” ""The crazy calendar, time to recover!"" tweeted Vinicius on Monday morning. Real, who revealed their squad for Liverpool later on Monday with Vinicius absent, did not announce how long he is likely to be out for but reports in the Spanish press suggest the 24-year-old will be sidelined for almost a month. Champions League holders Real take on in-form Liverpool on Wednesday evening having won two and lost two of their four matches in this season’s competition. They are 18th in the table, with the Reds top after taking a maximum 12 points so far. Vinicius has scored 12 goals for Real this term, including hat-tricks in two of his last five appearances. Ancelotti’s men, four points behind LaLiga leaders Barcelona with a game in hand, are next in league action when they host neighbours Getafe on Sunday."

That will come as alarming news to Liverpool supporters, who sang his name through the second half of the 3-2 win at Southampton on Sunday, when the Egyptian scored twice to seal a comeback and extend the Reds’ lead at the top of the Premier League table. Salah is having a stellar campaign, with 10 goals and six assists in his first 12 league appearances of the season. But the prospects of him extending his eight-season stay at Liverpool remain unclear. “Well, we are almost in December and I haven’t received any offers yet to stay in the club,” the 32-year-old told the media after the match at St Mary’s. “I’m probably more out than in. “You know I have been in the club for many years. There is no club like this. But in the end it is not in my hands. As I said before, it is December and I haven’t received anything yet about my future.” Asked if he was disappointed there had been no offer from Liverpool, Salah said: “Of course, yeah. I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans’ hands. Let’s wait and see. “I’m not going to retire soon so I’m just playing, focusing on the season and I’m trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well. I’m disappointed but we will see.” In September, Salah toldSky Sports:""No-one at the club has spoken to me about contracts, so I'm just like, 'OK, I'm playing my last season' and see what happens at the end of the season.” Sky Sports"

With Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate installed as first-choice by head coach Arne Slot, and Joe Gomez and academy graduate Jarrell Quansah ahead of him in the pecking order, the Dutchman decided it was time to move on. “I was very clear from the start that I wanted to play this season,” said Van den Berg, who has started 12 of Brentford’s 14 games since joining in late August. “At Liverpool you have two of the best centre-backs in the world at the moment. To me it was the right moment to leave, I’m at the age when I needed to play. “I’ve done it for many years going out on loan. It was time for me to make the permanent move and establish myself as a Premier League player and that’s what I’m doing so far. “I made the right decision (but) still a long way to go.”"

And all the signs, after another measure of his side's ability to overcome adversity, remain rosy. Errors were made, but the scoreline only ever briefly compromised. Liverpool look imperious, led by the magnificence of Salah, and have now opened up an eight-point gap at the top. It is hard to see Manchester City, 4-0 losers to Spurs this weekend, challenging at this moment in time, while slip-ups have also been made by Arsenal in recent weeks. Liverpool keep winning. The Slot steam train is rolling on at an alarming pace, and now they must consider themselves favourites for the title, despite the manager protesting otherwise. Of course, such sentiment will not be whispered outside the walls of their Kirkby training base, at risk of inviting complacency, but we are all thinking Liverpool are now the ones to beat. Apparently Slot ""doesn't do romanticism, he does wins"". Keep going at this rate and Liverpool will be in line to win the biggest prize of them all."

Slot's side were gifted the opener from a Southampton error but failed to capitalise in the first half before the hosts took a shock 2-1 lead after the restart. Salah then grabbed a double that took Liverpool eight points clear at the top. ""In the second half I saw the intensity I was looking for in the first half,"" Slot toldSky Sports. ""Southampton make it really difficult for many teams, including top clubs, and they made it difficult today, though we dominated the game completely. ""There was not enough urgency to arrive in the box (in the first half), we just kept the ball instead of attacking the box. Although we fell behind in the second half we showed more urgency and intensity. ""That led to numerous chances and eventually two goals. It is tough to create chances against a 4-5-1 low block but we know Southampton want to play out from the back so you have to be really aggressive, if not they have a really good game plan. ""Last season, it was even later on in the season Arsenal led by eight points and Man City came back so you know Arsenal, Chelsea, City and all the other teams are able to win so many games in a row. It's nice to have this position, but we are definitely not getting carried away."" Sky Sports"

11/4/2024,17:37,Slot hails Alonso’s ‘special’ managerial talent,"Liverpoolhead coachArne Slothas hailedXabi Alonso’s “special” managerial talents as he prepares to face the man many wanted to get the job the Dutchman now has. The former Real Madrid midfielder, who won the Champions League with the Reds in 2005, was the hot favourite to replace Jurgen Klopp when the German announced in January he was leaving at the end of the season. Alonso was flying high with Bayer Leverkusen at the time, eventually going on to win their first Bundesliga title with their only defeat of the season coming in the Europa League final. The Spaniard ruled himself out of the running early on, deciding to stay with the new German champions, but he remains the favourite to be Carlo Ancelotti’s long-term successor at the Bernabeu. But while Alonso continued to dominate the discussion even after his public announcement Liverpool’s search had moved on and eventually landed on Slot. Initial appearances suggest the appointment was the right one as the Dutchman has won 13 of his 15 matches in charge, losing only against Nottingham Forest and drawing at Arsenal. But Alonso’s return to Anfield, where he remains beloved long after his five seasons as a player, for a Champions League tie offers the chance to compare and contrast. “That he is special, that’s clear,” said Slot. “If you go to a club that was bottom of the league and with the same players you bring them all the way up without spending that much money in that summer, only bringing in one or two very good players, and they had the season (they had) and only lost the final of the Europa League, it tells you that he is special. “What it is that makes him special is difficult for me to say because I haven’t faced him yet and I haven’t worked with him. “What might be the situation is that he’s worked with very good managers in the past, he was a player with incredible insight in the game, he knew when to be where and he played at the highest levels so he knows and understands how these players feel in certain moments. “That probably contributes to what makes him a good manager. “How he is exactly so special? The best way to find that out is to talk to the players he has worked with and I haven’t done that yet.”"

Konate was replaced by Joe Gomez for the second period, but a subsequent assessment has revealed the issue is not serious. “Thanks for all the messages of support. My injury isn’t serious thankfully,” the France international posted on social media this afternoon. “I had a scan today and it confirmed there is no break. I’ll be ready for the next game.”"
11/3/2024,14:32,Salah: I'll never forget what scoring at Anfield feels like,"LiverpoolforwardMohamed Salahhas said that “no matter what happens, I will never forget what scoring at Anfield feels like.” Salah scored the winner in Liverpool's 2-1 home victory over Brighton on Saturday, a result that saw Arne Slot's side go top of the Premier League. However, the Egypt international's Liverpool contract expires at the end of this season and his cryptic message on Social Media following the Reds' win may worry Reds fans. ""Top of the table is where this club belongs. Nothing less,"" Salah wrote on Instagram and Twitter. “All teams win matches but there’s only one champion in the end. That’s what we want. A post shared by Mohamed Salah (@mosalah) “Thank you for your support last night. “No matter what happens, I will never forget what scoring at Anfield feels like.” Liverpool head coach Arne Slot recently reiterated that talks with Salah,Trent Alexander ArnoldandVirgil van Dijkare “ongoing” over new terms."
11/3/2024,10:00,Slot backs Gomez after Konate injury blow,"LiverpoolbossArne Slotwas full of praise forJoe Gomez’sperformance in Saturday’s 2-1 come-from-behind win over Brighton as he waits to learn just how much he might need to depend on the defender in the next few weeks. Gomez replacedIbrahima Konateat half-time at Anfield after the France defender came off the pitch nursing his left arm following an awkward fall. Slot said after the match that he was waiting to learn the extent of the injury, but revealed the 25-year-old was “in a lot of pain”. Should Konate now face a spell on the sidelines, Gomez showcased his ability to fill in with an impressive 45 minutes as Liverpool fought back from a goal down to win. It was Gomez’s seventh appearance of the season but only two of those – both in the Carabao Cup – have been from the start. “That says a lot about his mentality and it also says a lot about his quality, if you don’t play that much and you come in in a game where your team-mates were out-played for 45 minutes, that you can come in and play like this,” Slot said. “It also says a lot about his mentality in recent weeks and months where didn’t play that much that he is now able, without playing a lot, to play 90 minutes on Wednesday and then put in a performance like this on Saturday. “This is what people told me when I came in. Joe is a top, top, top professional who no matter what position he is in always gives his best for the team and for himself as well, and I think he got the reward for it because I think the fans loved what they saw. I definitely did.”"

""All three are playing really well at the moment and there are ongoing discussion with the people Virgil says he has to talk to, and that's not me as you know. I talk to him about other things.

The club have also issued out 75 lifetime bans and 136 indefinite suspensions to touts. A club statement said: “Liverpool FC continues to take decisive action against ticket touting, shutting down close to 100,000 fake ticketing accounts, while issuing 75 lifetime bans and 136 indefinite suspensions last season alone. “The number of accounts deactivated includes those cancelled following investigations and others blocked from sales or ballots due to suspicious online activity or identified as bots. “A further 5,670 accounts are currently under review by the club for suspicious activity, including supplying persons who have recently been charged by Merseyside Police for fraud related to ticket touting. A total of 1,500 tickets were cancelled across the 2023-24 season, either part of mass cancellations or from account holders who had already received sanctions, and the tickets were made available for resale. “The vast majority of lifetime bans and indefinite suspensions were handed down for unauthorised selling of season tickets, memberships or hospitality tickets, in breach of terms and conditions. This reflects the club’s zero-tolerance approach to all forms of ticketing touting.”"

Gakpo gave a timely reminder of his talents on Wednesday evening with a pair of powerful finishes before Luis Diaz sealed the Reds’ 3-2 fourth-round victory at Brighton. The Netherlands international has been a peripheral figure at Anfield since Slot replaced Jurgen Klopp in the summer, starting just two of nine top-flight fixtures. Slot, who made eight changes for the Amex Stadium tie, was impressed by the impact of his squad players, including his fellow Dutchman. “Cody’s been, in my opinion, a good player for Liverpool for a long time now,” said Slot. “He continues to bring that and that’s a good thing. For me, he is a regular starter. He’s not started every game but he’s started on a regular basis and he’s in tough competition with Luis Diaz who, when he went to the left (wing), also scored a goal. “That’s normal if you play at a club like Liverpool, you’ve got two quality players for many positions. But, for me, Cody has been a regular starter this season.”"

10/29/2024,12:39,Liverpool forward Jota out until after November international break,"Liverpoolexpect to be without forwardDiogo Jotauntil after next month’s international break. The Portuguese star had been in good form with four goals this season but he was forced off with an injury during the victory over Chelsea earlier this month and boss Arne Slot revealed the bad news ahead of the Reds’ Carabao Cup clash with Brighton on Wednesday. As well as cup and league matches against Brighton, Jota is also set to miss the Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund and the Premier League visit of Aston Villa. MidfielderHarvey Elliott, who has made only one appearance this season because of a fractured foot, will also remain out until late November butConor Bradleycould return against Brighton on Wednesday. Meanwhile,Federico Chiesa’s struggles continue, with the Italian forward beset by injury problems. Slot does not want to put a time frame on a potential return, saying: “He goes a bit up and down so sometimes he’s there with us training for a few days and then he goes out for an injury again. “I don’t want to put days or weeks on it because I think we just have to make sure he gets in the best possible shape and don’t put any pressure on him.” Slot brushed off suggestions he could return to Italy on loan in January, adding: “That hasn’t gone through my mind at all. “I think first and foremost is that he gets fit again and then we can see where he is. We’re trying to find the right way of building him up without overloading him. That has been difficult until now but I have full confidence that that will happen.” Slot changed virtually his entire team for the 5-1 win over West Ham in the previous round of the League Cup but does not expect to do the same this time. “I don’t think it’s possible to do the same as we did against West Ham for the simple reason that we’ve got some injuries so we don’t have maybe enough players to change them all – if I wanted that,” he said. “We’ve played on Sunday against Arsenal, yesterday there was mostly recovery for everyone so today we will find out how they all are then we have to make a decision who’s going to start.”"
10/29/2024,11:46,Slot believes Ten Hag will manage another big club again soon,"LiverpoolbossArne SlotbelievesErik ten Hagwill be back in a big job soon following his sacking byManchester United. Ten Hag’s two-and-a-half-year stint in charge of the Red Devils ended on Monday after a difficult opening to the season. By contrast, Slot has made a dream start to life at Anfield and he offered words of comfort to his compatriot. Speaking ahead of Liverpool’s Carabao Cup clash with Brighton on Wednesday, Slot said: “He’s a Dutch manager so it makes it even harder for me, for us as Dutch people. “Always your first thoughts are with the person. We are all in this job so we know that it can happen but, if it happens, especially because I know him a little bit and I know how much work he puts into it, then to get this news for him is of course a pity. “But we also know, especially us coming from Holland, how well he did at Ajax and that he won two trophies over here so we will see him I think in the near future at a big club again. “But at this moment for him and his family it’s, of course – tragedy is maybe a bit too much to say – but it’s a big disappointment.”"
10/29/2024,11:26,Could Chiesa move back to Italy?,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot: ""That hasn't gone through my mind at all. I think first and foremost is that he gets fit again, and then we can see where he is. ""There were reports in Italy, what I meant about him was he missed pre-season, and in pre-season he was on low intensity sessions because he had to train with three or four players apart from the group. Going from there to a high intensity league, to a high intensity playing style, is difficult in general for every player, but especially if you had a pre-season like this. ""We knew this before, so we knew we had to be really careful and adjust where we could to his individual needs, but it hasn't been perfect yet so we're trying to find the right way of building him up without overloading him, and that has been difficult till now, but I have full confidence that will happen."""

10/28/2024,17:26,Van Dijk brushes off early Havertz flashpoint,"LiverpoolcaptainVirgil van Dijkhas dismissed claims he should have been sent off in his side’s 2-2 draw at Arsenal by describing his off-the-ball clash withKai Havertzas “part and parcel of the game”. In just the sixth minute, Havertz was left in a heap on the Emirates Stadium turf after Van Dijk pushed him aside with his right arm and then appeared to strike the German twice with his left leg. Although Bukayo Saka opened the scoring for Arsenal, Van Dijk headed home from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s corner later in the opening period to draw his side level. Mohamed Salah then struck in the 81st minute to rescue a point for the Reds after Mikel Merino had earlier restored Arsenal’s one-goal advantage. But commenting on the early flashpoint with Havertz, Van Dijk said: “It is a physical game, and these things happen. “If you watch the battle we had during the game, it goes both ways, and that is part and parcel of the game.”"

Alexander-Arnold, whose contract at Anfield expires at the end of the season, said in a recent interview withSky Sports' Harriet Priorthat he would like to become the first right-back to win the coveted Balon d'Or award for best player in the world. ""My first thought when I saw that is you're not going to win the Balon d'Or as a right-back for Liverpool,"" Carragher said after Liverpool's 2-2 draw against Arsenal. ""Balon d'Or winners normally play for Real Madrid or Barcelona. That's where the best players in the world go. ""If that is his ultimate ambition - I think he was asked about winning the Champions League, the World Cup or the Balon d'Or and he went for the Balon d'Or - which I think is a bit strange or bizarre because it is a team game, but he has got massive ambitions and why not? You've only got one career, he 's a unique full back and he's absolutely amazing. ""But the first thing that came to me when I read that interview is that makes me think he is going to Real Madrid. ""I actually think Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah will stay. I do believe that, but the longer it goes on with Trent, the more I feel he is going to leave. ""It is the biggest club in the world. Going back to him being a local lad, there will be a frustration for Liverpool supporters the longer that this carries on and he doesn't sign a contract. "" Carragher added: ""There will be a frustration from Liverpool supporters if he moves on."""

The 64-year-old, who serves as director of scouting and recruitment, has resigned from his role and will depart by the end of 2024. Fallows had initially made the decision to leave before the arrival of Arne Slot, but stayed on to help with the transition between management eras at the club. Fallows was namechecked by Jurgen Klopp in 2020 over the 2017 signing of Salah, who has gone on to score more than 200 goals for the club. “We were sure he can help us. Michael Edwards, Dave Fallows and Barry (Hunter), they were really in my ear and were on it ‘Come on, come on, Mo Salah, he’s the solution!’"" Klopp said then."

10/25/2024,11:11,Slot rules out Diogo Jota for Arsenal clash,"Diogo Jotawill missLiverpool’sPremier League trip to Arsenal on Sunday, head coach Arne Slot has confirmed. The Portuguese forward suffered a rib injury in a collision during last weekend’s victory over Chelsea and has not recovered in time to make the journey to the Emirates Stadium. New signingFederico Chiesais also ruled out but defenderConor Bradleyis hoping to prove his fitness after a knock. Slot said at a press conference on Friday: “I think they feel good but not when it comes to playing for us at the weekend. “Federico might train with us today or tomorrow but Diogo definitely not and Conor Bradley – let’s see if he can be with us on Sunday.” Back-up goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher will continue to deputise forAlisson Becker, whose return date from a thigh injury remains unclear. Liverpool travel to Brighton in the Carabao Cup next Wednesday before hosting the Seagulls in the Premier League the following Saturday. Slot said of the Brazilian: “He is progressing well, like we expect, but it is not a short-term recovery so it is always difficult to judge him. “The best way to judge an injury is in the end phase and he is not there yet. “I can’t tell you how long he will be out but don’t expect him to be in against Brighton in the cup or next week.” Slot has made a superb start since taking over at Anfield in the summer, with 11 wins from his first 12 games in all competitions and his side top of the table. The hard-fought 2-1 defeat of Chelsea was generally considered to be their toughest test to date but Slot is expecting another step up against the Gunners, runners-up for the past two seasons. The Dutchman said: “I expect a lot from Chelsea this season and they showed it at Anfield. “But if you look at the last two seasons, Arsenal were [not only] far ahead of us, but also above Chelsea. “So you would assume that playing Arsenal will be more difficult. “Let’s see at the end of the season where Chelsea and Arsenal both are but normally you expect, especially as it is an away game, that this one is more difficult than Chelsea at home – and we all saw how difficult Chelsea at home was.” Slot has no doubt Liverpool’s title credentials will be measured in their games against the likes of Arsenal and champions Manchester City, who they face on December 1. He said: “Nobody knows at this stage who is going to be your competitor, but I think we all know Arsenal will be one of them. “Dropping points or winning points against them is always important. I think it was three draws and one loss last season [against the top two], so if you use mathematics, if Liverpool could have won all of them the league table would have been a bit different. “It is difficult to win in an away leg against Arsenal or City but it is something we are trying on Sunday, definitely.”"

Liverpool made it 11 wins from 12 under new manager Slot with a 1-0 win over RB Leipzig, with the attention now turning to Sunday's huge game at the Emirates Stadium. ""We know how tough an opponent Arsenal is in their own stadium at the Emirates,"" Slot toldTNT Sports. ""We have faced them this season before in the USA tour where both teams were not having all their players in yet. ""But Arteta has done an amazing job here in the last few years. But we know against Chelsea and in the last few days we have to be on the top of our game to do have any chance of getting a result, but we will do everything to get that."""

They also have a maximum six points from their opening two Champions League games but Arne Slot still sees much he wants to change about his side. “You can’t ask for much more when it comes to the results, but when it comes to what we want there is always room for improvement,” he said. “I don’t think we outplayed Chelsea, we certainly didn’t, I think they were more dominant with the ball. In an ideal world you would have seen us dominate the game like we did so many other games. We are not there yet. “The good thing about the team and our result is when we face a team like Chelsea or [Manchester] United you see a team fighting for every centimetre, every metre, fighting for every moment and that can be decisive in the game and that’s what we showed. “I am hoping that in the near future we will play a difficult game like the Milan game or the United game and be more dominant than we were against Chelsea.”"
10/22/2024,19:56,Szoboszlai knows the importance of his ‘dirty job’ with Liverpool,"Dominik Szoboszlaiis working hard to improve his goalscoring return but insisted it was more important that he is doing a “dirty job” for Arne Slot’sLiverpoolside. Last season, Szoboszlai chipped in with eight goals in 55 appearances for the Reds but so far this season his only strike came in the 3-1 Champions League win over AC Milan in September, and that has led to complaints from sections of the Liverpool support and, sometimes, his own manager. The 23-year-old said he is putting in the hours on the training ground to improve but he is more interested in the team’s results than his own numbers. When asked if he was happy with his form ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League match against RB Leipzig, Szoboszlai said he was not. “It can be always better so, no,” the 23-year-old said. “I can play even better. I can score more goals and do more assists. But I am doing a dirty job for the team and that is most important for me. We are top of league and if I don’t score goals that’s the most important for me. “If we are top of the league and I don’t score a goal I’ll take it…I’m trying to work on it to be in a position to score more goals. It will take time but I will get there.” Wednesday night will see Liverpool and Szoboszlai come up against his former club RB Leipzig in the Champions League. Szoboszlai spent two seasons with Leipzig after joining from sister club RB Salzburg in 2021, leaving for Liverpool in a deal worth a reported £60million in the summer of 2023. “It has been a quick one and a half years (since leaving),” the Hungary international said. “I came here as a young talent and left as a grown man and now I’m playing in the Premier League. “I learned a lot of stuff that I didn’t know before. You can always learn something from different coaches and different players and I can only say positive things (about the club)… “I’m happy to be back and to see old friends, and also the fans. I couldn’t really say a goodbye to them because my last transfer was a little bit quick.”"
10/22/2024,18:21,Slot: Big disappointment for Chiesa to be in and out,"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has also given an update on Federico Chiesa's fitness: ""I think it is always difficult with injuries to see where they are after a few days. ""Federico, it's more simple, he missed preseason, going to a league that is a higher intensity than Serie A. That makes it difficult for him to where the rest of the team is at. ""It has to do with him missing the entire preseason, so it is difficult to build up players. It is a big disappointment for him to be in and out, so we feel sorry for him, but he signed a long-term contract."""

The Reds were in a similar position last season, with a potential quadruple on the cards to to mark Jurgen Klopp's exit in style, but fell off in the latter stages of the season. Carragher is now tipping his former side to be active in the winter window in a bid to avoid a similar situation this time round. He said: ""They're very much pushing [to win the Premier League title], as they were last season. We shouldn't forget that. ""They haven't reinforced. It'll be really interesting to see if Liverpool do bring anyone in in January. They didn't bring too much in in the summer. ""And if they think they've got a realistic chance at the title and there's a player that they feel fits their criteria, their model, I think they'll pay the money to bring that player in."""

But now my full commitment and focus is on Liverpool and to be successful this season. “My own form is fine. I will let others do the talking. I don’t want to talk about myself.

""What is happening is they [Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mo Salah & Virgil van Dijk] were with their national teams, Trent scored a fantastic free kick,"" he said in Friday's pre-match press conference. ""Same question, same answer, there will always be talks and it is normal that you asked.

""But what you guys don't see and I do is how important he is on the training ground, he is always the one that is most loud in the sessions, he always brings a lot of energy and quality as well. ""So what you see at the weekend, I see during the week and that is what you are hoping for from a captain that he is not only showing his performances in the weekends, but also during the week. He is definitely our leader. ""If you are not from Holland then maybe it [criticism] is a surprise, but if you come from Holland, it is all about criticism in the Dutch media. I exaggerate a bit, but if there is a chance to criticise someone, Dutch people in general will find a way to do criticise you. ""I do not think he deserves this because he played some very good games for the Dutch national team in the last few games, so that is not a surprise to me. ""Is it a surprise he got criticism? Yes it is, maybe not by the Dutch media, but in general as if you have this fixture list, it is completely normal that you have a few days off. Some other players in Holland, who you do not know, did not come as they were tired. ""So how on earth you can criticise a player who has played every game for us and played the Euros.... but yes, it is the Dutch media."""

10/12/2024,09:14,Matip retires from football,"FormerLiverpooldefenderJoel Matiphas confirmed his retirement from football. The 33-year-old has been a free agent since leaving the Reds at the end of last season. Matip suffered an ACL injury in December of last year. Sky Sports 'Matip was both a cult figure and a hugely-respected defender at Liverpool'Analysis by Sky Sports' Richard Morgan: ""Joel Matip will go down as one of the most under-rated central defenders in Premier League history after his decision to hang up his boots, with Jurgen Klopp calling him one of the best signings he ever made. ""The lanky, German-born defender is only 33, but it seems all the injuries - and boy there were a lot during his eight years at Anfield - have finally caught up with him, despite there being some reports over the summer that he may take on one more Premier League assignment before calling it quits. ""Matip won every single trophy, apart from the Europa League, while at Liverpool and it says everything about how highly he was regarded at the club that, when fit, he was always chosen to partner Virgil van Dijk at the heart of the Reds' back line in over 200 games in all competitions. ""Mixed in with his rock-solid defending were touches of skill, whether it be bringing the ball out of defence, which he loved to do, or when setting up team-mates for goals as he did so memorably with a subtle flick for Divock Origi to help kill off Spurs to win the 2019 Champions League final at the Wanda Metropolitano.

10/9/2024,09:04,Why Alisson is a big loss for Liverpool,"Sky Sports' Sam Blitz: Liverpool face a crucial run of games coming up - with back-to-back league games against Chelsea and Arsenal straight after the October international break. Arne Slot's side will face some of the most in-form attackers in Bukayo Saka and Cole Palmer in those games, so missing goalkeeper Alisson Becker for the next month is a major loss. Sky Sports The Brazilian has produced big saves in big moments for Liverpool down the years but Alisson's biggest quality has been his consistency. Even with this season in its infancy, Alisson stands out as statistically the best goalkeeper in the division. Liverpool's solid defensive block under Slot means he hasn't faced much in terms of high-quality shots, but when he is needed, he is extremely reliable. It is why Alisson has only conceded two Premier League goals this season. The next best record is Arsenal's David Raya and Nottingham Forest's Mats Selz with six. Caoimhin Kelleher has stepped up plenty of times for Liverpool in recent years and made seven saves to keep a clean sheet when Alisson was absent against Bournemouth earlier this season. But with Liverpool also facing Brighton twice, Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa and Real Madrid before the end of December, this is a big spell in the season that the Irish goalkeeper will have to oversee."

""Quansah has impressed everyone at Liverpool with how seamlessly he has adapted to life in the first team after making his debut at Newcastle United in August 2023, with the 21-year-old going on to make 33 appearances in all competitions last season, barely putting a foot wrong as he won his first trophy after coming on a sub in the Reds’ League Cup win over Chelsea in February 2024.

9/16/2024,20:20,Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson wants player input into football calendar,"LiverpoolgoalkeeperAlisson Beckerhas called on football’s authorities to speak to players about their welfare as the Reds prepare to start an expanded Champions League campaign. UEFA’s elite club-level competition now involves 36 teams, which means an extra two matches in a group stage which now does not finish until the end of January as opposed to mid-December. The complaint about a packed calendar was usually one made loudly by former Reds boss Jurgen Klopp but Alisson has taken up the mantle and said the players are “tired” of the ever-increasing schedule. “For the supporters, it is amazing. More games, more bigger games, big teams against each other,” he said ahead of the clash against AC Milan in the San Siro. “For us players as well, it is good that you are going to play against the best in Europe – and it is always a good idea to add some games to the calendar that is not busy… I am being ironic a little bit. “Sometimes nobody asks the players what they think about adding more games so maybe our opinion does not matter. “But everybody knows what we think about having more games. Everybody is tired of that. “But we have to bring those kind of things on side and stay focused on the big challenge we have here.” The Brazil international was asked how many matches he thought was acceptable for a player to be involved in over a season. “This is not only a question I should answer,” added the 31-year-old who has just returned from South America where he played twice for Brazil. “Whether the number is 30 or 40. It is a matter to sit down all together and listen to all the parts because we understand we have the media and TV, the side of UEFA and FIFA, Premier League, domestic competitions. “We are not stupid, we understand that people want more games, but the reasonable thing would be for all the people I mentioned – those who make the calendar – to sit together and listen to all the parts inclusive of the players. “I think so many players have spoken already about that. We just need to be listened to. That’s what we would like to do, to sit together and understand what is the thinking of the direction that football wants to go – not only adding games, adding competitions, adding this and that. “What we want is to give our best for the football, if you are tired you cannot compete at a high level. “I want to give my best in all the games I play but we need a solution. It does not look like we are close to a good solution for football sake and players’ sake.”"

While the bar for Arne Slot's first season in charge was set at Champions League qualification following the wholesale changes over the summer, opening the campaign with three wins and no goals conceded raised expectations. However, those were punctured by a deflating 1-0 defeat - Forest's first at Anfield since 1969 - and Van Dijk said that should serve as a reminder of the high standards which need to be met. ""Overall it was a disappointing afternoon, something we didn't want to happen,"" said the Netherlands international. ""But we have to turn this around and make this sort of a reality check to be better for the rest of the season, because if you want to achieve things the contrast between the games we played is too big. ""We know how direct they are so playing against a big striker you can sometimes lose a challenge and you have to be ready for the second ball and every time there was a second ball they were on the right side of it. ""They got momentum in terms of winning the right challenges and they did they job very well and in terms of ourselves we weren't good enough. ""That's the disappointing part of it."" Van Dijk denied the more measured approach of his compatriot did not make it difficult to go up a gear when it was necessary. ""We still tried but I think we were too rushed, we put the ball in the box a bit too quick or overplayed it and then you don't get the momentum you want to get,"" added Van Dijk, who also rejected the suggestion the international break had interrupted their rhythm. ""It's difficult for me to say. Everyone is coming back from different places and playing a different way but still I think when we were not at our best we created chances and it should have gone better. ""But it is a performance we are definitely not happy with, we expect a lot better from ourselves and losing at home is something that can't happen. ""We have to turn it around pretty quickly and that will be the focus."""

The 25-year-old, who started for his country in Saturday’s 2-0 Nations League defeat by England, is number two at Anfield – where Arne Slot has replaced Jurgen Klopp as manager – behind Brazilian Alisson Becker, but with Georgia international Giorgi Mamardashvili due to arrive on Merseyside next summer, his future appears to be up in the air. Asked about his situation at Ireland’s pre-match press conference ahead of Tuesday’s clash with Greece, Kelleher said: “I made it clear in the last few years, I want to go be a number one and play week in, week out. “The club made the decision to get another goalkeeper. From the outside looking in, it looks like they have made a decision to go in another direction. “My ambition has always been clear the last few seasons that I want to be a number one, playing week in week out. “Sometimes from the outside looking in, it looks like it is 100 per cent my decision but at times, it is not always in my hands.” Kelleher, a two-time Carabao Cup winner with the Reds, deputised ably for Alisson last season after the Brazilian suffered a hamstring injury, and made 26 appearances in total. He was linked with a move away in January and then again during the summer, when Nottingham Forest reportedly had a series of bids rejected. Asked how close he came to leaving the Reds during the summer, Kelleher said: “My mission was to go out and play, and be a number one. “It has been reported that Liverpool had rejected a few bids as well. It is not always in my hands to make the decision. My ambition is to prove I am good enough to play week in, week out.”"

Van Dijk said: “At both teams I am still Virgil van Dijk, the big leader! And I certainly want to remain that for the next two years. ""I am human, I have emotions too. You start thinking all kinds of things. Especially just after a game like the elimination [by England at Euro 2024] in the very last minute. “I also understand that it came across unclear on how I stood in all this, because after the match I was so disappointed and full of emotion. It perhaps came across as if it had been my last international match. I did have doubts that night and I did hint at that. “It's very good that I went on holiday the next day, was able to spend time with my children, my family, which is the most important thing in my life. I was able to share it and then very quickly things calmed down.” Van Dijk added: “It was a very long and intense season last year, including the Euros. I focus on the team and the boys so much. I always try to talk and am constantly busy with everyone. I've had that responsibility for years. As captain, it's the team first and then yourself. “But it should not be at the expense of your own performance. In my opinion, I have always managed that very well. When I am in a bubble during the European Championship, I feel very responsible for all sorts of things. That can sometimes bring some difficult moments. “Did that come at the expense of my game? I am someone who does not look for excuses easily and I am realistic. “From a footballing point of view, it could have been better personally. I have come to that conclusion. Not that things went badly, not at all, but the expectations are very high and I wasn't able to live up to that.” Van Dijk continued: “The moment I started talking to the national coach, I was already fine with it. It is quite normal that the national coach and the captain make an analysis about how the European Championship went. “But it is also about the confidence you get and you look at your own ability and ask whether you are still important enough. I am very much important, on and off the pitch. I don't like to say that about myself, but I am. The responsibility at the club and at the national team is still super big.”"

7/5/2024,10:34,Hughes: Slot's style suits Liverpool players,"Richard Hughes on criteria used to appoint Slot: ""That playing style that attracted us to Arne is based on subjective footballing opinion and data, as you would expect. ""In all the metrics, Arne's Feyenoord team came out really well, playing front-foot, attacking football, with intelligence and passion. ""It think it blends really well with our current squad, our supporters and football club as a whole. ""It depends on the players you have and the players you would like to recruit. This style of playing that Arne has is the most attractive to watch, in my opinion. ""I believe it will be so in the opinion of the fans and that is the most important thing. ""There is a duty here to play that kind of football and grab games by the scruff of the neck. ""It's not going to be a hugely different style to what has been successful in the past. We hope to emulate that."""
7/5/2024,10:31,Slot looking forward to facing Guardiola,"Arne Slot on facing Man City boss Pep Guardiola: ""It's something to look forward to but I think there are many more good managers in this league, which is normal. English people like to believe this is the best league in the world and I believe this as well. ""It's normal that if you work in such a league, there are many good managers who you are going to face and Pep is one of them, that's for sure. ""I'm lucky enough that I lived in an era where I saw his Barcelona team. Then, when Pep left, there was a new era and that was the rivalry between Liverpool and Man City. ""I've seen a lot of that rivalry and I am looking forward to working here, but not specifically to playing against Man City because there are many nice teams we are going to face, starting with Ipswich of course, which is at this moment the most important one."""
7/5/2024,10:28,Slot: Klopp leading chant was 'special',"Arne Slot on advice from Jurgen Klopp: ""We've spoken about many things but no more than normal. It stays between us. ""Him singing the song for me was special because there are not many managers the fans sing for. ""I was fortunate enough that after a few years at Feyenoord they started to sing for me. ""But coming over here, without having worked here or winning a game, there are already fans singing for you - that's a good start!"""
7/5/2024,10:27,Slot: Klopp has left a winning culture,"Arne Slot on whether he is daunted by taking over from Jurgen Klopp: ""Not at all. You can look at it both ways. Yes, there are big shoes to fill. But also you can look at it in the way that you inherit a team and a squad that has a winning culture. ""One of the reasons to come here is that I do feel we have a really good team and a really good squad. As a manager, you want to work at a club where there are good players, with the opportunity to win something. ""The past has shown there is a possibility for Liverpool to win some trophies. You can look at it as being the successor of someone who is really successful, but I look at that as ideal. I like to work with players, I like to improve them, but I like to win as well and there is an opportunity at this club to win."""

I worked with Feyenoord and my former clubs like this. ""There are not many clubs in the world where one person decides everything. It's a collaboration between people. ""I don't think there are many sporting directors who will bring in players the manager doesn't like, or the other way around. ""But it's not only the two of us at a club like this. There are many more people who will bring their opinion. ""I like to work like this."""
7/5/2024,10:22,Slot excited to get to know Liverpool players,"Arne Slot on his immediate priorities in the job: ""Getting to know the people that work here, getting to know the players – as people but mainly as players, because I’ve seen a lot of games and training sessions but you get to know them even better if you are with them together – and then implementing playing style. ""But it’s not that we’re going to change everything here because a lot of things are done really well. But we have to find ways to improve. I took my time for that. I was off for a lot of weeks, so I had a lot of time to look at where we can improve.

They did really well [last season] and if they continue doing so, there is a fair chance they will play."""
7/5/2024,10:19,Slot: My priority is to get the team ready,"Arne Slot when asked about the importance of getting to know Liverpool as a city: ""It takes some time to understand everything but the way I'm going to use the time in the upcoming weeks is to put the team in the best possible way for us to be ready for the first game. ""It helps if you get to know the city, but it helps even more if you win most of your games. I think, with Jurgen, it was a combination of getting to know the city and getting to know the style of play the fans like. ""One of the reasons Liverpool came to me is that our playing style is not so different. We both like the fans to come into the stadium and see a team that plays with a lot of energy, that plays good football, and that is the thing I am most focused on. ""If we do that in the best possible way, that will probably give me some time and, if I have time, I can then get to know the city a bit better. But it all starts with improving the team and winning as many games as we can."""

Clearly it was a difficult position at first because there were important jobs to finish where we were, and important jobs to finish here at Liverpool. ""Since then, we've been in communication daily over logistics, organisation and preparing the transfer window, which is something we will know more about as we go on and we know more about our current squad, which we are delighted to have inherited. ""We need to improve on the training pitch and, with the window open, we will be opportunistic. If we can improve certain areas as we go, we will look to do that. ""Contractual situations I don't think would be fair for me to talk about. These are private matters between the club and players. ""The only concern I have is total commitment from the players to the cause for next season and we're absolutely convinced that is the case."""
7/5/2024,10:12,Slot: My aim is to make the team better,"Arne Slot on his hopes of improving Liverpool: “If you work in this league, everyone gets better every season, so it’s also important for us to improve. ""One of the [reasons] is because our competitors improve as well, but that’s normal when you work in the biggest league in the world. ""You can expect other teams to get better and that’s also the aim we have and the reason why we come in every day, to make the team and the players better.”"
7/5/2024,10:10,Slot: Klopp was more than the 'normal one',"Arne Slot asked about Jurgen Klopp introducing himself as the 'normal one': ""It's special what Jurgen did to this club. When he arrived, he said he was the 'normal one' but what made him special was the impression he left behind, winning trophies and his playing style - the fans loved it.

The players returning will be a mixture of senior and fringe players, due to Euro 2024 and Copa America involvement, but among those expected are Mohamed Salah – whom Egypt wanted for the Olympics but are increasingly resigned to being disappointed – Endo and Curtis Jones, who was cut from England’s extended squad before they travelled to Germany."

Slot has a huge job following Klopp and Euro 2024 will complicate his pre-season plans as he tries to get to know his new squad but Van Dijk has publicly offered one piece of advice regarding his summer preparations. “One thing I do know is we need a good break after our tournament because otherwise we will be in trouble as well going into the season,” he added. “Hopefully the new manager will look into that as well.” On what the future may hold under Slot, Van Dijk said: “I am very curious and have a lot of questions all the time. We will see; the Premier League and Liverpool is obviously a different ball game but we are here for him, I’ll be here for him whatever he needs. “It is all about sticking together and giving him the chance of showing what he is capable of with the other guys who will come in. “He probably knows already but everyone knows our expectations are always huge and it is about managing that in the right way and getting the maximum out of all of our players. “It starts with having a good break and then we are ready to go again.”"

At the moment there is nothing for me to say,” said the 32-year-old defender after the club bade an emotional farewell to Klopp following the 2-0 victory over Wolves. “Nothing has changed and nothing is on the table either.

Teenage midfielderStefan Bajcetic, who has been out since September, is also back in training but is likely to have to wait a little longer for a first-team return. “Obviously we didn’t rush it with the boys,” said Klopp. “That means they did a lot of training by themselves. Diogo and Trent worked as a group since two, three weeks and could do really proper training. It was very good yesterday. “Stefan is different a little bit because he was out for much longer but is now training with us for longer as well. I think after the long spell he had without playing football it makes sense that we might give him a game in the under-21s and then let’s see how he deals with that. “That’s not the plan with the other three guys. They are now back in training and now we have to see how we involve them, how we use them. That we need them is clear, but we need them in the best possible shape and we want to give them a kind of rhythm. “It’s always a challenge to reintegrate the guys but, with the quality they have, obviously it should be a bit easier and we will use them in the next days and weeks.

2/29/2024,10:57,Liverpool announce £9m loss for 2022-23 season,"Liverpool made a pre-tax loss of £9m last season as increased commercial income did not offset a drop in money made from media and matchday revenues. The previous 12 months had produced a small profit of £7.5m. Liverpool's biggest income stream in 2022-23 was the £272m, up £25m, generated from off-field income, but a last-16 Champions League exit a year after reaching the final meant television money dropped by £19m to £242m. Matchday revenue also fell by £7m due to fewer games being played across last season after the previous campaign when the club played in every fixture - a total of 63 - they were eligible for, winning both domestic cups and reaching the Champions League final. While overall revenue remained the same at £594m, increasing costs are cutting into the balance sheet with staff expenses having increased 79 per cent since 2018, up from £208m six years ago to £373m for the year ending May 2023. The wage bill in this period alone rose £7m to £373m. Administrative expenses for that same period have increased by 70 percent from £320m to £562m, while utility costs have doubled from two years ago while rising inflation has driven up other costs. ""Operating this great club in a financially sustainable manner and in accordance with football's governing principles has been our priority since FSG [Fenway Sports Group] acquired LFC in 2010,"" said managing director Andy Hughes. ""Despite the significant growing costs of football, the success of our commercial operations demonstrates the strength of our underlying financial position so we can continue to operate sustainably while competing at the highest levels of football. ""While these financial results are a moment in time on our journey, what remains constant is the growing global appeal of the club and, thanks to our amazing support, LFC continues to be the most globally followed club in the Premier League."" Matchday revenue will increase after the new Anfield Road stand was fully opened earlier this month, taking Anfield's attendance to 61,000. ""Matchday revenue is a hugely important part of our overall financial sustainability model,"" added Hughes. During the reporting period Liverpool signed Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo, Calvin Ramsay and youth team goalkeeper Kornel Misciur for a combined initial fee of £105m, but offloaded Sadio Mane, Divock Origi, Takumi Minamino and Neco Williams. There were also significant contract renewals for Mohamed Salah - who became the highest earner in the club's history with a reported £300,000-a-week deal - Joe Gomez, Harvey Elliott, Curtis Jones, Jarell Quansah, Stefan Bajcetic and BenDoak."
