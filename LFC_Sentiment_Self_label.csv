3/17/2025,16:51:00,'There's no other stopper in world football as gifted',"When Plato theorised about his world of Forms many centuries before Christ, he wasn't to know his weighty philosophical musings would one day be exhumed in an email newsletter to describe a silly little football match. But here I am, hoping my secondary school philosophy teacher will one day read this and know I actually was listening, struggling to think of a better way to describe Liverpool's 1-0 victory over Paris St-Germain. The only way I can is to understand it as a smash-and-grab of such Platonic perfection that it belongs among the great thinker's higher realm of Ideals. Plato posited all that we see on Earth today is merely an imperfect copy of that which exists in its true form, its perfect form, somewhere beyond the physical. But if he were alive today and signed up to whichever Greek subscription channel broadcasts the Champions League, he will have seen a goalkeeping performance to make him consider tearing up his papyrus scroll. To pull off such a footballing heist requires magnificence from the man between the sticks - and Alisson duly delivered for his side in the French capital. ""It was probably the performance of my life,"" he said after the game, before being hailed as ""the best in the world"" by Liverpool's late goalscoring hero Harvey Elliott. On Wednesday's evidence, it's impossible to disagree with the youngster. Alisson has only won one Yashin Trophy - the annual award given out since 2019 to the best goalkeeper on the planet - but for my money, there's no other stopper in world football as gifted with both hands and feet. Sign up for the Football Extra newsletter The latter were rarely used at the Parc des Prince though, this was a performance that needed hands alone - and multiple pairs, ideally. Alisson made nine saves throughout the contest, the most a Liverpool goalkeeper has made in a single game logged by data site Stathead for at least a decade. Those chances were of decent standard too, Les Parisiens' 27 total shots worthy of a combined 1.6 expected goals during 90 minutes of near-complete dominance. Liverpool had just 30% possession and took only two shots - both season-low tallies by a distance. To take the conversation to even nerdier heights, we can use Stathead's post-shot expected goals metric to illustrate the quality of PSG's shots on target during the contest. Where xG values the chance at the point of the shot being taken, PSxG shows how likely a shot is to go in after it has been kicked based on where it goes on goal. A powerful shot low to the corner has a high post-shot xG, while a weak shot at the keeper has a low one and a shot off target would return 0. By this metric, the stats say Alisson's acrobatics actually prevented 2.3 goals, the most-influential goalkeeping performance of the last decade in which Liverpool have kept a clean sheet, according to Stathead's logs. For all the Brazilian keeper's brilliance, the chips still need to fall your way to win a game in the manner Liverpool managed. All supporters, myself included, can find it tough to acknowledge luck's role in victory, as if in doing so it makes the final result less valid. However Reds boss Arne Slot had no hesitation pointing out his side were smiled upon by the footballing gods, admitting: ""Had we got a draw, we would still have been the lucky ones. They were much the better team today."" With the tie poised deliciously ahead of next week's return leg at Anfield, Slot will know that big improvements are needed to keep their course to the quarter-finals steady. For now though, Liverpool can savour a famous European victory. On nights like this, when luck and skill collide, even Plato would admit that the shadows on the cave wall aren't bad to look at after all.",BBC,"'There's no other stopper in world football as gifted' When Plato theorised about his world of Forms many centuries before Christ, he wasn't to know his weighty philosophical musings would one day be exhumed in an email newsletter to describe a silly little football match. But here I am, hoping my secondary school philosophy teacher will one day read this and know I actually was listening, struggling to think of a better way to describe Liverpool's 1-0 victory over Paris St-Germain. The only way I can is to understand it as a smash-and-grab of such Platonic perfection that it belongs among the great thinker's higher realm of Ideals. Plato posited all that we see on Earth today is merely an imperfect copy of that which exists in its true form, its perfect form, somewhere beyond the physical. But if he were alive today and signed up to whichever Greek subscription channel broadcasts the Champions League, he will have seen a goalkeeping performance to make him consider tearing up his papyrus scroll. To pull off such a footballing heist requires magnificence from the man between the sticks - and Alisson duly delivered for his side in the French capital. ""It was probably the performance of my life,"" he said after the game, before being hailed as ""the best in the world"" by Liverpool's late goalscoring hero Harvey Elliott.

The travelling Liverpool fans spent the moments around full-time atManchester Citygoading followers of the champions. While they did so, Dominik Szobozslai was the focus of countless social media comments for his decision to lie face down in the turf at the final whistle at a rain-soaked Etihad Stadium. The Hungarian clocked an impressive 11.5km on the day, a mark only bettered by Phil Foden on 11.7km. Szobozslai's 20 sprints on the day was only topped by Savinho on 23. It was a day for running after all. Liverpool clocked just 33.9% of possession, their lowest in a Premier League victory on record (since 2003-04).  A look at the average positions players took up on the day points to Manchester City building in Liverpool's half, while the Reds stayed deeper, compact and efficient. Arne Slot's side played 126 passes in Manchester City's half, while their hosts completed 427 in Liverpool territory. It was an afternoon where stinging the opponent with a couple of razor-sharp attacks won the day. Szobozslai was a key cog, offering coverage of the pitch, finding the net and assisting Mohamed Salah's opener. Salah, meanwhile, added an assist of his own and - while not running as far as his team-mate - offers grit of a varied nature. The Egyptian - seen primarily as an attacking force - won seven of his 10 duels. If his fight wasn't enough, he created three chances - a Liverpool high - and, perhaps most significantly, offered the game-defining moments that continue to set him apart. Salah has now completed a goal and assist combination 11 times this season. That tally is the most by a player in any of Europe's big five leagues since Lionel Messi did likewise with 11 in 2014-15. Salah still has almost a third of a season to put daylight between himself and the sublime Argentine before the season ends. Szobozslai deserved his brief - if somewhat damp lie down.

Nobody would dispute PSG should have won the first leg, and they always looked dangerous in the second leg. I really hope they win the trophy. Good that Liverpool have no league games until April now, but the Carabao final has suddenly become a bigger challenge. Tim:Over the two legs the better side went through...just. They had more of a threat up front. I don't understand why footballers can't use their weaker leg to clear a ball like Konate didn't. I think there might be some changes for Sunday after that. Great game for the neutral. It could have been the final, it was so open. M:Generally a great performance. Robertson, Mac Allister, Szobo all top. Quansah came on with confidence. Pens were poor, which was a real shame. Overall PSG probably edged it over two legs. Still a league and cup to go. Karen:Well it had to happen. It's been a very busy campaign for Liverpool this season. I feel it is beginning to take its toll on the players now. I hope we have better fortune on Sunday. Vardon:Facing facts is always difficult after such a deflating loss. We have a missing link in central midfield, and that's a priority in the summer. If we lose all three players out of contract it's a major rebuilding of the squad as well. At this point it almost feels as if winning the Premier League is a consolation. Down, but not out in terms of the season as a whole. Darwin, it's a long goodbye after tonight, I'm afraid. Ken:Fine margins but PSG were better across the two legs. They have got their recruitment spot on eventually with dynamic and energetic players all across the park with dollops of bravery in their work in and out of possession. Slot and the players have done remarkably well to date and this is where FSG's failure to strengthen the squad in defence and midfield hurt us.

They have now become pivotal parts of the team in different areas of the pitch. And yet it is how they coped with the match circumstances on Sunday and their opponent's strengths that was the real masterclass in adaptability.

3/17/2025,13:44:00,How Szoboszlai's improvement has driven Liverpool towards title,"Dominik Szobozslai won possession back eight times for Liverpool in Wednesday's 2-0 win overNewcastle- a high for his team - as well as winning eight of his 10 duels. His coverage of the Anfield turf was comprehensive - tracking 10.9km, which was the furthest clocked by any player on the night. His endeavour in recent weeks has been obvious. Said to have contracted and been hampered by a virus late in 2024, this year, he has found his legs, his touch and the confidence that comes with such improvements. Not a Liverpool fan? Find and follow your club here Away from the gutsy effort, Szobozslai has added a finishing flourish to his game at the most critical of times. On this page on 17 January, we posted the graph below showing he was the only player in Liverpool's attacking arsenal to be significantly underperforming his expected goals. The powerhouse midfielder should have applied the finish to 4.31 goals and was floundering on just two, with two assists. Five weeks ago, Dominik Szoboszlai was the only Liverpool player underperforming their xG by a significant amount. For clarity, Szobozslai had recorded two goals and two assists in 18 Premier League outings at this point, with the Reds coming off a draw atNottingham Forest. In the eight league games since, he has scored three times and added a further assist. He also scored in the Carabao Cup semi-final win againstTottenham. He is still underperforming his current xG of 6.6 but the differential has narrowed, with him now on five league goals in total. Furthermore, his return to form and presence are key in a critical triangle in Arne Slot's team. On the graphic below, the thicker the line, the more passes a player plays or receives from a team-mate. Much has been made of Trent Alexander-Arnold's superb relationship with Mohamed Salah. Against Newcastle, the pair shared 22 passes. What perhaps goes underappreciated is how Szobozslai is the third cog in the system. In Wednesday's win, he shared 14 passes with Salah and the same number with Alexander-Arnold, making himself an integral link between two of Liverpool's most creative forces. From harassing opponents, winning the ball back (only Gravenberch, Alexander-Arnold and Mac Allister have won possession more for Liverpool this season) and adding goals in recent weeks, there can be no doubting Szobozslai's significance. The Kop has already started serenading the league title. Salah will rightly take the plaudits but the marauding Szobozslai has proven a driving force at a pivotal moment.

But now, the Reds look like they will go on to win it because of their squad depth and stability. I know Arsenal are close and pushing but I don't see Liverpool losing three games between now and the end of the season. They have great cover in the forward areas, so there is competition for places, and then there is the form of Mohamed Salah. He has been unbelievable this season. They are also solid at the back, despite having had injuries. Alisson missed a chunk of games and that did not really make a difference to them. Ibrahima Konate was also injured and Joe Gomez stepped in fine, and there have also been issues with Trent Alexander-Arnold. But despite all of that, this is a telling time for Liverpool because it was around this time last season that they won the Carabao Cup and were ahead in the Premier League - and then really fell away. Arsenal will be looking at the gap and thinking six points is not that much, but they are still inconsistent. Liverpool probably feel a lot more comfortable being chased down by Arsenal thanManchester City, who we know can go on a crazy run of games to close a gap.

Liverpool probably feel a lot more comfortable being chased down by Arsenal thanManchester City, who we know can go on a crazy run of games to close a gap. I still think City will do that, but the title is too far gone for them. If Liverpool can get through this patch of games then they will go on to win the league because, overall, they look much better than they did last season.

3/17/2025,16:05:00,'We had never seen a derby like it',"This video can not be played  BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty has been reminiscing on the 4-4 thriller that took place between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park in the 1991 FA Cup fifth round. After a goalless first meeting at Anfield, the Merseyside rivals played out an exhilarating draw, which ended up being Kenny Dalglish's final match before resigning as manager of the Reds. Substitute Tony Cottee's equaliser six minutes from the end of extra time secured a draw for the hosts after they fought back from a goal down four times. The second replay, also at Goodison, finished 1-0 to the Toffees - the last FA Cup tie to go to multiple replays before a rule change the following season limited ties to one replay. ""It was an absolutely wild game because Liverpool led four times and Everton pulled them back four times,"" McNulty said. ""Liverpool scored some absolutely wonderful goals, some strange goals, people clearing the ball off the line and it flying back in. ""Every time you thought Liverpool had won the game there would be some calamity in their defence that bought Everton back into it. It was an incredible game of football. ""I remember walking away from that and people from our vintage were saying they had never seen anything like it. ""It was an absolutely wild night of football.

3/17/2025,17:50:00,An alternative approach for big tests,"Gravenberch (38) and Mac Allister (10) received only 11 passes from Liverpool's defenders or keeper in the win at PSG. All of them went to Mac Allister. There are many ways to win a football match - and Liverpool seem to be exploring some alternatives. For Wednesday's late triumph in Paris, the Reds spent large spells on the backfoot, creating occasional promising breakaways but almost entirely lacking care when countering. In some ways, their defensive stance mirrored the 2-0 win atManchester Cityon 23 February, with Arne Slot's side being more clinical and nurturing of the ball when picking their moments at the Etihad. Consider this: Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister, Liverpool's two deepest midfielders, received a total of 11 passes from the entire back four and goalkeeper in Paris - and all of them went to Mac Allister. That means the role of a traditionally deep-lying midfielder to receive the ball off the defenders or the keeper completely bypassed Gravenberch as he did not receive a single pass from the five men behind him on the night. Such a move seems like sacrilege for those brought up on a diet of Didier Deschamps, Claude Makelele or - if you're a red - Dietmar Hamann. So why did it happen? Was the PSG press too suffocating for Liverpool to use their playmaking midfielders? Or is this an alternative way to tackle a football match? At City, Mac Allister and Gravenberch received a total of nine passes from defenders. All of them were given by the full-backs, with Alisson, Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate not playing a single ball into the midfield duo. Contrast these two fixtures with the 2-0 home win overNewcastlethat took place between them on 26 February (below graphic). Liverpool's backline played 44 passes into Mac Allister and Gravenberch. That's more than four times the number sent into the midfield frenzy during these past two away matches. So, while PSG's press was impressive, it seems apparent Slot wants his side to play with less risk on the ball in key areas - notably centrally - in these big away tests. Instead, his aim is to move the ball up the pitch swiftly, bypassing midfield, as they did expertly for Harvey Elliott's late winner. It is a tactic - or the applying of a handbrake - to watch out for and shows once again that there are many ways to win a football match.

They spent brilliantly to dominate the Premier League, but could buy with impunity. A ??50m full-back does not work out? No problem, they just get another. Liverpool would not get away with spending huge money on Kalvin Philipps and Mathueus Nunes, for example. If we stumped up ??100m on this pair, that would be it - the midfield budget gone. So Erling Haaland's new contract grates for a few reasons. Firstly, Liverpool's own superstars have not had their deals renewed. FSG are haggling over the money and length of terms and we might lose Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk. Three of the best players on the planet. City though, despite being in a rut, extend Haaland for a decade. Secondly, City have endured their first poor run in a very long time and immediately, Pep Guardiola is given money to fix it. Claudio Echeverri has come in, with Omar Marmoush and Abdukodir Khusanov arriving shortly in what could be a ??100m+plus January spend. Liverpool are crying out for defensive reinforcements but the right opportunity just does not arise. Thirdly, Haaland's renewal suggests City are extremely confident their punishment for the 115 charges will be minimal. After all, why would the Norwegian commit his whole career to a club facing potential relegation? Liverpool need a win againstBrentford, badly. And a contract or transfer announcement, however unlikely, would be nice, too.

They stayed cool after falling behind, even as they struggled to find their rhythm. But Mo Salah is not their only game-changer. Cody Gakpo is another.

3/17/2025,9:00:00,'Champions' performance' - fans on victory at Man City,"We asked for your thoughts afterSunday's Premier League gamebetween Manchester City and Liverpool. The result moved the Reds 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League. William: Liverpool's defence was spot on. They were consistently pushing City back and when City did break through them, Liverpool were switched on and stopped them. Then, their attacking was sublime and the goals were well deserved. It was a champions' performance. Chris: Mohamed Salah understandably gets many of the plaudits, but Dominik Szoboszlai was equally impactful and ran strongly for the whole game. This wasn't the Manchester City of recent years, but they are still worthy opponents, and thus this victory should be celebrated. Irene:A really solid performance. They all battled, even though my nerves were gone with Jeremy Doku on Trent Alexander-Arnold! Ryan: Very resilient and professional display. Was impressed with how solid we were defensively and we did well to take advantage of our chances. We all know City are always a tough opponent - don't think we've won at Etihad Stadium for yonks - so a great achievement. Arne Slot deserves immense praise for how he set the team up and managed the game. Thought Ibou Konate and Virgil van Dijk were first class with Szoboszlai very impressive as well. Superb display! Vinni: Stats are so irrelevant - this performance is maybe my favourite Liverpool display of the season. The Reds simply toyed with City, who looked mid-table at best. Only Doku earned his payslip.

Best be on alert.",BBC,"'Champions' performance' - fans on victory at Man City We asked for your thoughts afterSunday's Premier League gamebetween Manchester City and Liverpool. The result moved the Reds 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League. William: Liverpool's defence was spot on. They were consistently pushing City back and when City did break through them, Liverpool were switched on and stopped them. Then, their attacking was sublime and the goals were well deserved. It was a champions' performance. Chris: Mohamed Salah understandably gets many of the plaudits, but Dominik Szoboszlai was equally impactful and ran strongly for the whole game. This wasn't the Manchester City of recent years, but they are still worthy opponents, and thus this victory should be celebrated. Irene:A really solid performance. They all battled, even though my nerves were gone with Jeremy Doku on Trent Alexander-Arnold! Ryan: Very resilient and professional display. Was impressed with how solid we were defensively and we did well to take advantage of our chances. We all know City are always a tough opponent - don't think we've won at Etihad Stadium for yonks - so a great achievement. Arne Slot deserves immense praise for how he set the team up and managed the game. Thought Ibou Konate and Virgil van Dijk were first class with Szoboszlai very impressive as well. Superb display! Vinni: Stats are so irrelevant - this performance is maybe my favourite Liverpool display of the season. The Reds simply toyed with City, who looked mid-table at best. Only Doku earned his payslip.

Here are some of your comments: West Ham fans James: It's really scary how easy teams can play through us. Our defence do not show an eagerness to get the ball, unlike our competitors. We make far too many mistakes and choose wrong options going forward. If Niclas Fullkrug needs to play, I'd rather see Jarrod Bowen on the left and Mohammed Kudus on the right. I don't know why we keep playing Paqueta either - he clearly has lost all motivation to try his best. The manager needs to go, and Graham Potter needs to come in. Now. Michael: Truly awful performance. Just can't do the basics. I don't blame the manager. This is on the players and they were very poor. Spineless really. Binner:Disappointed. To be honest, I didn't expect a different result with the way Liverpool have been playing, but our performance was disappointing. All you David Moyes haters; what do you say now, eh? Fraser: We've got the worst goal difference outside the bottom three and, time and time again, defence is our weakest area. It was the same towards the end of the Moyes era - heavy defeats have become commonplace. We have talented defenders so there must be something lacking in terms of organisation, tactics and teamwork at the back. Get that sorted and the rest of the team have something to build on. Liverpool fans Shay: Liverpool were brilliant going forward but that was also a very poor West Ham team defensively. Mohamed Salah is surely in line for the Ballon d'Or next year if he keeps this up. Only Cole Palmer comes close to him in world football right now. Bigger tests to come but nice to see all our frontline get a goal. Over reliance on Mo may be also be our downfall were he to get injured. Stephen: Another well disciplined display. Could have been double figures. Forget the contract problems - the three in question are not showing any discomfort and are just getting on with it. Role on Man Utd.

3/17/2025,19:13:00,Was Alexander-Arnold scrutiny against Man Utd warranted?,"""Wasn't his best game"" and ""schoolboy stuff"". After Sunday's game againstManchester United, Liverpool boss Arne Slot admitted right-back Trent Alexander-Arnoldwas not at his best, while former midfielder turned pundit Roy Keane lamented the defender's display. But was Alexander-Arnold's performancereally that bad? It depends where you look. After reports surfaced during the week thatReal Madrid had approached Liverpool about the 26-year-old, who is out of contract at the end of the season, there was always going to be more focus on him during this game. With nearly 55% of United's attack coming down Liverpool's right according to Opta, it was clear Ruben Amorim's side were targeting any potential vulnerability - and the creativity of Bruno Fernandes and of Diogo Dalot took full advantage. But this is not the first time Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities have been questioned and, even this season, he has statistically had worse games. Against the Red Devils, the England international lost possession 27 times - the second-most of a Liverpool player in the Premier League this season, but still fewer times than he gave the ball away in their defeat byNottingham Forest(33) earlier this season. What would be concerning for Reds' fans, however, is the regularity in which he loses high amounts of possession during matches, with the right-back appearing seven times in the top 10 for possession lost in games by Liverpool players this campaign. Alexander-Arnold was surprisingly only dribbled past twice by opponents on Sunday, a figure  that has been topped by himself on six other occasions so far this term. But, with no tackles recorded and all five of his duels lost, his willingness and ability to get stuck into the opposition in such an intense derby game for Reds' fans will have frustrated supporters. Despite this, Alexander-Arnold won possession more times (eight), had more touches (97), made more interceptions (four) and equal the amount of passes (63) as any Liverpool player in the match. And, as shown in their heatmaps, the defender covered more of the pitch than fellow full-back Andy Robertson - although the amount of play coming down the right side from United will have had an impact. With transfer silly season only just beginning and the games only going to get tougher, the scrutiny around Alexander-Arnold looks set to intensify.

3/17/2025,17:35:00,Why Slot should now use Elliott more,"Darwin Nunez got the headlines on Saturday, and rightly so, but Harvey Elliott also made a massive impact off the bench. The 21-year-old was involved in both goals in what was his most telling contribution of the season.

Elliott got injured early on and has never been able to force his way in, tellingly not even coming off the bench in the 1-1 draw atNottingham Forestlast week. AtBrentford,though, Slot gave him 10 minutes - and Elliott changed the game, proving himself as a creative force. The midfielder found spaces between the lines and showed an ability to make intricate passes into the penalty area. Szoboszlai is a better presser and more physical, while Jones is good at retaining possession, but Elliott has superior vision to both. Hopefully, Slot will now use him more, especially against teams who park the bus, because Elliott has the ability to find attackers in the box instead of just spreading the play wide every time. Jones has now got himself in the England squad, and if Elliott gets the minutes his talent deserves, he could too by the end of the season.

The nine-and-a-half-year contract Erling Haaland signed with Manchester City on Friday, which is reported to be worth ??500,000 a week to the Norway striker, was a reminder of the financial power a select number of top-flight clubs have. Sky Sports It sits in stark contrast to Liverpool?€?s current situation with three of their top stars Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold out of contract in the summer.

And while City are pushing through a January mini-rebuild with the signing of at least four players which could exceed ??150m, the likelihood Liverpool will make a significant move remains slim.

Their combined weekly wage is estimated at ??750,000, with Salah the highest earner in the club?€?s history with a weekly pay packet of ??350,000. And while City are pushing through a January mini-rebuild with the signing of at least four players which could exceed ??150m, the likelihood Liverpool will make a significant move remains slim. Asked whether City?€?s financial power meant his Premier League leaders cannot afford to drop their own high level of performance, Slot said: ?€?Not particularly about the investment but we know how good we have to be every single day to compete in this league. ?€?It is not only the club you are referring to, Chelsea also spend ??1.2 billion, [Manchester] United spends an incredible amount. ?€?Every team spends a lot of money over here, that?€?s why it?€?s such an interesting league to be part of. ?€?Some season this club spends a bit more, other seasons other clubs spend a bit more. That?€?s what makes this league so intense and so difficult to win. ?€?But that?€?s also the reason why we want to be here: you want to compete against the best, with the best, and we are very happy with the team we have at the moment and we are still able to compete with all the teams that are spending incredible amounts of money.?€?",slot happy see competing big spenders liverpoolhead coacharne slotis happy team compete biggerspending premier league rivals nineandahalfyear contract erling haaland signed manchester city friday reported worth week norway striker reminder financial power select number topflight clubs sky sports sits stark contrast current situation three top stars mohamed salah virgil van dijk trent alexanderarnold contract summer combined weekly wage estimated salah highest earner clubs history weekly pay packet city pushing january minirebuild signing least four players could exceed likelihood make significant move remains slim asked whether citys financial power meant premier league leaders cannot afford drop high level performance slot said particularly investment know good every single day compete league club referring chelsea also spend billion manchester united spends incredible amount every team spends lot money thats interesting league part season club spends bit seasons clubs spend bit thats makes league intense difficult win thats also reason want want compete best best happy team moment still able compete teams spending incredible amounts money,1,Pre-Match Review,2025-01,p

The previous 12 months had produced a small profit of ??7.5m. Liverpool's biggest income stream in 2022-23 was the ??272m, up ??25m, generated from off-field income, but a last-16 Champions League exit a year after reaching the final meant television money dropped by ??19m to ??242m. Matchday revenue also fell by ??7m due to fewer games being played across last season after the previous campaign when the club played in every fixture - a total of 63 - they were eligible for, winning both domestic cups and reaching the Champions League final. While overall revenue remained the same at ??594m, increasing costs are cutting into the balance sheet with staff expenses having increased 79 per cent since 2018, up from ??208m six years ago to ??373m for the year ending May 2023. The wage bill in this period alone rose ??7m to ??373m. Administrative expenses for that same period have increased by 70 percent from ??320m to ??562m, while utility costs have doubled from two years ago while rising inflation has driven up other costs. ""Operating this great club in a financially sustainable manner and in accordance with football's governing principles has been our priority since FSG [Fenway Sports Group] acquired LFC in 2010,"" said managing director Andy Hughes. ""Despite the significant growing costs of football, the success of our commercial operations demonstrates the strength of our underlying financial position so we can continue to operate sustainably while competing at the highest levels of football. ""While these financial results are a moment in time on our journey, what remains constant is the growing global appeal of the club and, thanks to our amazing support, LFC continues to be the most globally followed club in the Premier League."" Matchday revenue will increase after the new Anfield Road stand was fully opened earlier this month, taking Anfield's attendance to 61,000. ""Matchday revenue is a hugely important part of our overall financial sustainability model,"" added Hughes. During the reporting period Liverpool signed Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo, Calvin Ramsay and youth team goalkeeper Kornel Misciur for a combined initial fee of ??105m, but offloaded Sadio Mane, Divock Origi, Takumi Minamino and Neco Williams.
