3/17/2025,17:48,'Everything was sunshine and rainbows' - Van Dijk,"Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk says ""good things"" await the Reds if they can ""turn"" their fortunes after a testing spell. Van Dijk featured as Liverpool exited the Champions League on penalties against Paris St-Germain and lost the Carabao Cup final at Wembley in a difficult few days for the club. But the Reds still top the Premier League by 12 points with only 27 left to play for, with their next fixture set for 2 April when they host Everton at Anfield. Van Dijk told BBC Radio Merseyside: ""We have to turn this around [PSG and Newcastle defeats]. ""It's how football works. In five days you lose twice and the world is sinking - sort of. Two weeks before everything was sunshine and rainbows. ""Now everyone goes to their respective countries, play there, hopefully stay fit and then we have a couple of days to settle down and then we train and we have to be ready for Everton at home which is going to be tough. ""There's a lot at stake - good things - we're in a good position. There are so many positive and good things to look forward to. We play for the Premier League - the most difficult prize to get. ""In my opinion, one of the toughest Premier League seasons there is in the last couple of years in terms of everyone can win from each other so it's very difficult."""
3/17/2025,15:14,Is Salah's cup finals record his Achilles heel?,"Alongside his team-mates, it was a difficult day for Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah at Wembley on Sunday. In the 2-1 loss toNewcastle, the forward failed to record a shot or create a chance for his side. But, in a season in which his incredible Premier League form looks set to take the Reds to a title in Arne Slot's first campaign in charge, a bad day at the office can be forgiven. However, was it just an off-day? Or a familiar tale for Salah? There is no question that the Egypt captain's goals and assists have been crucial on a number of occasions on route to cup finals, but when he gets there, there seems to be a struggle to produce the same numbers. In seven major cup finals for Liverpool (not including Community Shields and European Super Cups), Salah has scored just the one goal - a penalty againstTottenhamin the 2018-19 Champions League final - and not provided an assist. The penalty means he has failed to score a goal from open play in any of those finals. Salah has been unfortunate on a couple of those occasions, being forced off through injury in the 2018 Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid and in the first half of the Reds' 2022 FA Cup final penalty shoot-out win overChelsea. Salah's statistics and records speak for themselves and there is no doubt he will go down in history as one of Liverpool's greats - but is this record in cup finals (both for club and country) the one chink in Salah's impressive armour? How do you feel about Salah's record in finals, Liverpool fans? Is it a frustration? Or do his goal contributions elsewhere mean this record can be forgiven? Let us know"
3/17/2025,15:00,Liverpool 'can suffer' final defeat - James,"Former Liverpool goalkeeper David James says Liverpool ""can suffer"" Carabao Cup final defeat to Newcastle given their position in the Premier League. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""The best team on the day won and that's why we love the cup, you never know who's going to win until that final whistle and I don't think there can be any complaints about the way Newcastle and Eddie's team went about it - that's football. ""I think fortunately Liverpool, with the Premier League position at the moment, can suffer it. It would be very different if it was something that had cost the only trophy option that they have got this season."""
3/17/2025,13:55,"'We want to bounce back, and we will'","Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk on Instagram:""First of all congratulations to everyone at Newcastle United. It's been a difficult and disappointing week for us, and it's very hard for me to put it in to words right now. Only thing I can say is that we want to bounce back, and we will."""
3/17/2025,12:06,'Lack of quality depth must be addressed',"In the space of a week, the Arne Slot machine that was cruising in three competitions, has ground to a halt. After exiting the Champions League to Paris Saint Germain and losing to Newcastle United in the League Cup final, Liverpool's sole focus is maintaining their lead at the summit of the Premier League to win silverware this season. In a campaign that started with little expectation, after Jurgen Klopp's departure, the feeling amongst supporters shifted vastly, due to the nature of the performances at the start of the campaign. Sunday's defeat is just the sixth since the new head coach arrived. Yet the feeling is Liverpool are now akin to a sports car that has started to run out of fuel. It's a familiar story. Last season, after winning the League Cup, the club faltered in all other competitions and eventually ended the season with one trophy. History is repeating itself. The lack of energy and fight at Wembley highlighted a problem: a lack of depth in midfield and defensively, which is now starting to cost them. Liverpool ended the second leg against PSG with Endo - a defensive midfielder - at centre back, while Jarell Quansah was at right-back due to a lack of available players in that position. Assuming Curtis Jones is your first available option to bring in for the starting midfield three of Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister and Dominic Szoboszlai, the options past that aren't of the same standard. There's been little room to rotate in that area due to the drop off in quality and that is starting to show. That lack of quality depth must be addressed to avoid making similar mistakes. Thiago, Diogo Jota and Kostas Tsimikas were brought in on the back of winning the Premier League in 2021. Jota's arrival has been a quality bit of business, and Tsimikas provides competition at left back, but Thiago didn't hit the heights you'd expect consistently. After winning the Champions League in 2019, the signings in the summer included Sepp van den Berg, whose LFC career saw him make three starts before being sold on for a sizable profit, Harvey Elliott - who could be set to follow a similar path - Andy Lonergan and Adrian. Takumi Minamino arrived in January. Without further investment, a title win this season could become an anomaly. The best time to improve is when you're still on top. Just ask Manchester City - who next season you expect to return to being title challengers, as well as the other teams around that top four race all looking to improve. Under Klopp, the team fought on all four fronts a couple of times. The reality is the squad isn't that far off being able to do that. The last thing Liverpool should want is to go backwards and end up scrapping for a Champions League place. It's a good job they have a healthy lead in the league because they are currently stuttering towards the Premier League title."
3/17/2025,09:55,'We played into their hands',"Andy Robertson says Liverpool ""didn't use the ball well enough"" in Sunday's Carabao Cup final defeat toNewcastle. The Reds dominated possession with 66% but only managed seven shots to the Magpies' 17 and rarely threatened before Federico Chiesa's late goal. ""I don't think we got into our rhythm,"" Robertson told Total Sport Merseyside's Mike Hughes. ""I don't think we played our game, which is hugely frustrating when you play a final. ""Credit to Newcastle. Their game plan worked and they were perfect and were far from perfect. ""We had to get the ball down and play and we didn't do that. We need to analyse it when we come back, it's still too fresh and too raw to really know what went wrong."" Although Arne Slot's side had suffered Champions League disappointment earlier in the week, Robertson rejected suggestions there was a hangover at Wembley. ""I don't think so,"" he added. ""We had enough time to recover from that. ""You have to get yourself up for cup finals. I just think we maybe played into their hands a little bit. We maybe played too many long balls and it turned into a second-ball fight which Newcastle are so good at. ""But I don't think we played to the levels that we've been used to this season.""

3/17/2025,08:28,'A chastening week' - fans on Carabao Cup final defeat,"We asked for your thoughts after Liverpool lost the Carabao Cup final toNewcastle. Here are some of your comments: James:Poor performance which had been coming for a while. When Salah doesn't perform it highlights how poor our other forwards are. Don't understand how Jota, Diaz and Nunez are getting game time ahead of Chiesa. Newcastle wanted it more - I think that's worrying as we have tough games left in the league. We need to find that spark again or this could get messy. Newcastle deserved the win spo well done to them. Jimmy:On this occasion we were outdone by the tactics Newcastle employed. We were second best the entire game and Newcastle fully deserved the victory. They were like an unforgiving rash. Michael:Liverpool didn't turn up. Jason:This was a very disappointing performance from us. Newcastle United were up for it, we weren't and we were soundly beaten. The scoreline flatters us immensely. This has been a chastening week for us. We know we are not the best team in Europe. We need the international break to reset ourselves. We have nine games to prove that we are the best team in England. Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys! Sarah:Newcastle thoroughly deserved to win - we didn't play our normal game. We were too rushed with passes going astray, Diaz didn't take Trippier on when he had the beating of him. Jota missing in action and no idea what happened to Mo as he was starved of decent service throughout the game. The players seemed tired so maybe the starting line-up should've included Elliott and Jones while Gakpo was not match fit. Virgil van Dijk held the team together but it was beyond him today. Paul:Very disappointing display, Newcastle fully deserved the win. We badly missed Trent Alexander-Arnold's creativity. One slight complaint about Arne Slot is he doesn't change the team enough. It showed. Still, if we can win the league, it's an amazing season and the one prize every fan would have taken above anything else without question."
3/17/2025,08:15,Newcastle 'preyed' on Reds who were made to 'feel heavy-legged',"Newcastle""smothered"" Liverpool ""and made the players think they were tired"" says former Reds left-back Stephen Warnock. ""They played extra time on Wednesday against Paris St-Germain and immediately Newcastle put them on the back foot and made them feel heavy-legged,"" Warnock told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. ""They smothered them and made it difficult for them. ""After the week Liverpool have had, I wonder if Arne Slot might look back and think one of the biggest lessons was not making more changes for theSouthamptongame. ""They were 13 points clear going into that game and they made just three changes. Would he have made more looking back now? The league will take care of itself over the course of time and they are still good enough to see it through, but this Liverpool team looked tired at Wembley. ""But credit to Newcastle because they preyed on that and made the most of it."" Listen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC Sounds"

3/17/2025,20:03,'Newcastle deserved the win',"Liverpool boss Arne Slot, speaking to Sky Sports about his side's defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final: ""The game went their way in the sense that we played the game in the way they would want. ""There was a lot of free-kicks, set-pieces and they are and were today very strong at that. That also led to the first goal. ""The second goal was a cross from the side and they are taller, maybe stronger in the headed duals. Both goals came from that. ""We have to be better with the ball which is not so easy, the moments when you have the ball you have to create more and you are always waiting for a moment where the game can go your way and more space can open up. ""Normally in a game like this in the end of the first half and in the second half it opens up a bit more but we gave them the positive mindset of being 1-0 up and not long after the break they made it 2-0. ""Then, they're just going to fight harder for every ball and we did have one or two chances but altogether Newcastle deserved the win."""
3/17/2025,19:53,'Not giving Liverpool the excuse of being tired',"Former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Mo Salah was poor, he struggled in the game. He did not turn up at all today. ""Newcastle were brilliant and they smothered Liverpool, they made it difficult for them. Don't forget how many players Liverpool threw forward towards the end It looked in doubt towards the end, but they deserve this. ""Whether they were tired from the game against Paris St-Germain in the week - I'm not giving them that excuse, they don't deserve that excuse. You have to give all that credit toNewcastle, the way they set themselves up nullified Liverpool and they were outstanding."" ""Virgil Van Dijk stood at the Newcastle huddle at full-time. He went around and shook every player's hand. He respected what Newcastle have done today. Class. A sign of respect for Newcastle."" Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, speaking on Sky Sports: ""Newcastle didn't just win today, they battered Liverpool. ""I find it difficult to be too critical, given what Liverpool look like they will go on to achieve. ""Newcastle are a great Premier League team and they have wiped the floor with them today. I'm gutted Liverpool didn't win today but if there is any team you would accept losing to, it's Newcastle."""

3/17/2025,12:34,Sutton's predictions: Liverpool v Newcastle,"We all know how much it would mean for Newcastle to end their long wait for a major trophy, but they have not beaten Liverpool since December 2015, a run of 17 games. When you consider the Magpies are without Lewis Hall and Anthony Gordon - their entire first-choice on the left flank - I really don't see that run ending at Wembley. I am expecting Tino Livramento to replace Hall and try to stop Mohamed Salah. Livramento is mobile and quick, but I don't think he will keep Salah quiet all game. It won't be easy for Liverpool, though. They are without Trent Alexander-Arnold and, with Conor Bradley likely to be sidelined too, they will need to find someone to fill in at right-back. The midfield battle will be key, because Newcastle are very good in that area, especially now Joelinton is back alongside Bruno Guimaraes and Sandro Tonali, but it is one of Liverpool's strengths too. Arne Slot's biggest issue is how the Reds will react to the disappointment of going out of the Champions League against Paris St-Germain, but I don't see them having a hangover from that shootout defeat. My gut feeling is that we will see a few goals, and Liverpool will win in 90 minutes. Sutton's prediction: 3-2 Read the full predictions and have your say here"
3/17/2025,15:50,'Born ready' Quansah 'grateful' for Van Dijk help,"Liverpool defender Jarell Quansah has a tattoo on his arm which says 'Born ready' and he will need to be on Sunday if, as expected, he is called upon when the Reds playNewcastlein the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday. ""My tattoo is [something] my dad used to say when I was younger before every game,"" the 22-year-old explained. ""He used to say, 'Are you ready?', and I'd say, 'born ready'. So that's where that came from. Hopefully, I will be ready on Sunday."" Quansah is set to be used at right-back by Reds boss Arne Slot against the Magpies because of injuries to regulars Trent Alexander-Arnold and Conor Bradley, while Joe Gomez - the usual deputy in that position - is out with a hamstring issue. Liverpool will be aiming to win the EFL Cup for a second successive season, having beatenChelseain last year's final in which Quansah came on during extra-time. ""These sort of weeks, I think about myself when I was young and what I'd be thinking if I was in that position. I think just to enjoy myself and the occasion, it's going to be special,"" said the defender. Quansah will go into the final on the back of being called up to England manager Thomas Tuchel's first squad and is using the knowledge and experience of Liverpool captain and Netherlands centre-back Virgil van Dijk to help in his development. ""He's lived my career,"" said Quansah. ""He's been a young centre-half, made mistakes, and then reached the pinnacle, the very top of football, and been one of the best centre-halves that we've seen. ""He can resonate a lot with me and, anything he can do to help me, he's trying to do and I'm grateful for that. ""On a day-to-day basis, he is always talking to me. It's all valuable information that I take from him."" Slot took Quansah off at half-time when Liverpool won atIpswichin their opening game of the season and, while the young centre-back feels he has ""dealt with it pretty well"", he admits it is ""tough"" not playing as much as he would like this season. ""It's all about learning for me,"" added Quansah. ""There are going to be times when I play good and bad but, as long as I'm learning and becoming a better player, then in the future I know I'll be fine. ""It's just trying to keep perspective about what sort of stage of my career I'm in at the minute - trying to learn off the best and become consistent as a whole."""

3/17/2025,14:03,'Kelleher deserves to play' in final - Westerveld,"Former Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld hopes head coach Arne Slot plays Caoimhin Kelleher in goal for Sunday's Carabao Cup final despite opting for Alisson in the semi-final againstTottenham. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside, Westerveld said: ""I was surprised when Alisson played in the semi-finals because usually Kelleher plays all of these games, but I think it was to do with Alisson coming back [from injury] and getting him for the Champions League. ""Kelleher deserves to play the game as he has been so good for us, but I won't be surprised if he leaves at the end of the season because a goalkeeper wants to play.

""I don't want to create any anxiety or anything like that. I just keep my head down and focus on hopefully winning the next 10 games,"" said the 33-year-old centre-back. ""Maybe I will run this fully down and then there is still no news - I don't know. ""It's not a one-two-three discussion and there we go. There are multiple factors.

3/17/2025,19:32,Cup final just as 'special' for Liverpool as Newcastle - Slot,"Arne Slot had to jokingly remind those in attendance as his news conference on Friday that his team were playingNewcastle Unitedin the Carabao Cup final on Sunday. He had been asked about plenty of issues surrounding the Reds, from Virgil van Dijk's future, injury concerns, how his players were feeling after their Champions League exit and Jarell Quansah's England call-up, before getting on to the Magpies. And, while Newcastle have not won a major trophy in 56 years, Slot does not believe  the Wembley showpiece is a bigger game for them than a Liverpool side who won the competition last season. ""No, I don't go along with that,"" said Slot, who has plenty of incentive for victory as it would give him his first trophy in charge of the Anfield club. ""A final in this country is always special because of the fact that there are so many strong teams. ""If you reach a final, it is always a big moment for them - but also for us. It is special for them - but also for us."""
3/17/2025,19:01,'Surreal feeling' to be named in England squad - Quansah,"Liverpool centre-back Jarell Quansah says ""it is a surreal feeling"" to be named in Thomas Tuchel's first England squad. The 22-year-old is yet to make a senior international appearance, despite being included in Gareth Southgate's training squad before Euro 2024. Since then, he has made 21 appearances for Liverpool and has been impressive at the back when called upon by Arne Slot. ""I was in the last camp but it was to just step in, so this is the first one where I feel part of the squad,"" he told BBC Radio Merseyside. ""Football is about ups and downs and I wasn't picked for the Euros, so it was about bouncing back and being in a better position this season."" Listen to more on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,17:02,Should he stay or should he go?,"When Thomas Tuchel announcedhis inaugural England squadon Friday, Harvey Elliott could be forgiven for feeling a bit wistful. At the end of last season, the 21-year-old was on the fringe of Tuchel's predecessor Gareth Southgate's considerations for Euro 2024 - now, he is not even in the conversation. Yet to start in the Premier League under Arne Slot, Elliott has been reduced to cameo roles off the bench or appearances in cup competitions alongside the second-string players, albeit few would expect him to start the Carabao Cup final on Sunday. Elliott arrived at Anfield as a 17-year-old in July 2019 and has only had one loan spell away - a very successful campaign atBlackburn Roversin the Championship in 2020-21. With a solidified place in Liverpool's first XI looking further away than ever, what next for the talented midfielder? Not a Liverpool fan? Find and follow your team here Elliott has actually played more minutes in both the Champions League and the FA Cup this season, notably scoring the winneragainst Paris St-Germainat the Parc des Princes 10 days ago. That was off the bench but served notice of his enduring talent and eye for a goal. Last season, he supplied 11 assists, demonstrating the value of a regular run in the side. One assist this season therefore is a paltry return, even if there remains time to improve it. In terms of his England credentials, he ought to be well placed to step up to the senior side, boasting 20 appearances for the under-21s, including one as captain, and scoring eight goals. Of course, there is considerable competition in his position for England. Few in world football can compete with the likes of Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Phil Foden - albeit the latter two are out of form right now. Foden actually makes for an interesting comparison too. Closely guarded byManchester Cityboss Pep Guardiola during his formative years, there were some who argued it would be better for him to leave in order to progress his career. Foden never listened, instead biding his time at the club he supports and ending up a fundamental part in bringing a shedload of trophies to Etihad Stadium. Elliott is older now than Foden was then, but he is a Liverpool fan and that may well mean he has a longer tail of patience when it comes to fully breaking through at his favourite team. Whether Slot is taking such a long view of the midfielder's future or fancies cashing in on his potential may be a key topic this summer."
3/17/2025,13:55,Is Liverpool the best place for Elliott to develop?,"What Harvey Elliott does next depends whether or not he feels like he is still developing well enough at Liverpool. He is good enough to be playing week in week out, but is he getting better if he goes to a different environment where the situation is not the same? At Liverpool he is behind some big players in terms of a starting berth, but he is also getting the opportunity to play and score in the biggest competitions and is surrounded by players who are trying to win huge trophies. As a player he can learn a lot from that mentality and that setup. Even if he is not playing every week, he has to be ready. I think the fact Arne Slot does still play him means he does trust him and if he will be manager for a long time then you would imagine someone like Elliott would be part of his plans for the long term. It can be hard, however, for a player to think of the long term if in the short term you are not getting as many minutes as you feel you could be getting. I stress ""could"" rather than ""should"", because deserving is very subjective. I would say as long as he feels he is developing as a player in ways other than just playing 90 minutes every week, then Liverpool is by far the best place for him to be because he has developed there and has played in some of the biggest games in club football. Elliott is 21, he is young enough to be able to go and find a future somewhere else, but in many years' time he can look back and be glad he stayed at the club he loves having won the trophies he has and can still win. Nedum Onuoha was speaking to BBC Sport's Nat Hayward"
3/17/2025,11:18,Slot hails Quansah's 'mentality' after England call-up,"This video can not be played Arne Slot on Jarell Quansah's England call up Arne Slot has praised Jarell Quansah's determination following the defender's England call-up by Thomas Tuchel on Friday. The 22-year-old was received some negative press after being replaced at half-time on the opening day of the season at Ipswich Town but has established himself as an important member of Slot's squad. He will likely start in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday, ""It says a lot about his mentality,"" said Slot. ""I think last season everybody saw what a talent he is. He showed in recent performances that he outgrew being a talent and that's what Tuchel saw by calling him up."" Slot also highlighted Quansah's versatility, saying the defender offers the team a different attacking dimension while playing as a right-back. ""In the last few times he had to play for us it was in a position he is not completely used to as right full-back,"" he said. ""But in my opinion, he has the quality to play in that position because he is strong, fast, very comfortable with the ball and it gives us an extra quality if we play him."""
3/17/2025,10:44,"Slot on Alexander-Arnold, recovering from PSG and Carabao Cup final","Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Carabao Cup final againstNewcastle(kick-off 16:30 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: As anticipated, Trent Alexander-Arnold is unavailable but Slot expects the right-back to return before the end of the season. However, the Liverpool boss is hopeful Ibrahima Konate will train today and then a decision will be made ahead of Sunday. He said ""in this part of the season it is almost impossible to have all of your players fit"" so it is no surprise both Liverpool and Newcastle have key players sidelined for the final. More from Slot on the absentees: ""Both teams have two or three that can't play and that's almost a privilege as some teams have had more all season. It's the minimum you can expect after four months of non-stop football. It's a compliment to the medical staff of both clubs that it is not more."" On Virgil van Dijk's comments he still has 'no idea' whether he will be at the club next season: ""The only thing I know is that I want Virgil to be here next season and for no more talk about contracts."" After their exertions against Paris St-Germain on Tuesday, Slot said it is ""normal for players to be tired after extra time, especially after playing such an intense 90 minutes"" but said Liverpool will be ready to go again at Wembley. Reflecting on the Champions League defeat to Paris Saint-Germain: ""I liked the game because it was all about pure football. I have seen so many games recently where it is all about time delays and dives. This was two teams going all out in possession and attack. Pure football and it is a big compliment to PSG that they were able to beat such a strong Liverpool side."" In response to whether Darwin Nunez has needed his spirits lifting after missing his penalty: ""I assume Curtis [Jones] felt the same? It's the same for every player that takes a penalty and misses, but the all the others didn't feel great after as we lost and they all took responsibility because you can miss a chance like you miss a penalty. We were closer to winning the game in the 90 minutes and with penalties you need a little bit of luck. I don't want to make anything more of it."" On the opportunity presented by the final: ""We are really looking forward to it - you cannot take a final for granted in this country. Everyone wants to play a final. That is one of the reasons we get out of bed in the morning. Everyone wants to win trophies."" On suggestions it is a 'bigger game' for Newcastle given their 70-year wait for a major trophy, Slot said it is ""a big moment"" for both clubs to be in the final.

3/17/2025,08:33,Chance to make up for disappointment in Europe,"Since becoming Liverpool manager, Arne Slot has not had too much adversity to deal with but he had the disappointment of his side being knocked out of the Champions League on Tuesday. Since then, the Dutchman has had to pick himself and his players up for the Carabao Cup final on Sunday againstNewcastle United. The match will be Slot's first trip to Wembley and gives him and his team the chance to erase the hurt of the result against Paris St-Germain by lifting a first trophy of his tenure. Slot will be speak to the media at 10:00 GMT today so we will find out what sort of state the Reds are in mentally and physically. On the team news front, Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold had to go off injured against PSG and is unlikely to be involved.

3/17/2025,09:23,Liverpool 'won't take anything for granted',"In reality, every player is different but most of the players in the build-up to the Carabao Cup final will want to stick to their normal routines. But it is a very hard thing to do when you know the scale of the game ahead. Getting a chance to play at Wembley is always a huge privilege and one that players do not ever take for granted. Interestingly for these teams, Liverpool have won there in recent years butNewcastlelost two years ago. Liverpool are trying to retain their trophy from last season, knowing that they are also in a great position in the league, even if they are now out of the Champions League. What is the energy like? Have they recovered and understand this is part of the process? Looking historically, it suggests that they can, but they know they will be arriving as favourites. Newcastle caused Liverpool problems this season in the game at St James' Park so they will not take anything for granted. The game feels bigger for Newcastle because their history is not littered with trophies or Wembley appearances and the Reds have has significant success in terms of major trophies in the past 10 years - but it is huge for both teams. The chance to win any trophy in any season is a privilege and to walk up those steps and lift it in front of all your supporters who have come down for this one-off day is amazing. You can never take that for granted. It is a case of being prepared, being ready for the moment and understanding the lights will shine down on you for that game. It is a case of making sure they are not too bright for you given the occasion. Nedum Onuoha was speaking to BBC Sport's Nat Hayward"

The 33-year-old is out of contract this summer, alongside Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold. ""I still have no idea at the moment, genuinely. At the moment I don't even know what will happen next year. If anyone says they do know, they are lying to your face,"" he said.

3/17/2025,09:25,Fan views on Champions League exit,"This video can not be played I hope fans didn't want 'incredible' game to stop- Slot We asked for your views after Liverpool were eliminated from the Champions League by Paris St-Germain. Here are some of your comments: Roger:Bottom line is that Liverpool lost to a better team and sometimes you have to accept that, rather than search for shortcomings in your own performance. Nobody would dispute PSG should have won the first leg, and they always looked dangerous in the second leg. I really hope they win the trophy. Good that Liverpool have no league games until April now, but the Carabao final has suddenly become a bigger challenge. Tim:Over the two legs the better side went through...just. They had more of a threat up front. I don't understand why footballers can't use their weaker leg to clear a ball like Konate didn't. I think there might be some changes for Sunday after that. Great game for the neutral. It could have been the final, it was so open. M:Generally a great performance. Robertson, Mac Allister, Szobo all top. Quansah came on with confidence. Pens were poor, which was a real shame. Overall PSG probably edged it over two legs. Still a league and cup to go. Karen:Well it had to happen. It's been a very busy campaign for Liverpool this season. I feel it is beginning to take its toll on the players now. I hope we have better fortune on Sunday. Vardon:Facing facts is always difficult after such a deflating loss. We have a missing link in central midfield, and that's a priority in the summer. If we lose all three players out of contract it's a major rebuilding of the squad as well. At this point it almost feels as if winning the Premier League is a consolation. Down, but not out in terms of the season as a whole. Darwin, it's a long goodbye after tonight, I'm afraid. Ken:Fine margins but PSG were better across the two legs. They have got their recruitment spot on eventually with dynamic and energetic players all across the park with dollops of bravery in their work in and out of possession. Slot and the players have done remarkably well to date and this is where FSG's failure to strengthen the squad in defence and midfield hurt us. Hopefully, they can recover well and bounce back in the next game to ensure the run-in is still a glorious climax."
3/17/2025,08:19,Alexander-Arnold set to miss final,"Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to miss Sunday's Carabao Cup final against Newcastle after limping off in the Reds' Champions League defeat against Paris St-Germain. The full-back twisted awkwardly in the second half of Tuesday's shootout defeat. In more positive news, Ibrahima Konate's withdrawal during the PSG loss could be down to fatigue rather than injury. Manager Arne Slot told his post-match press conference: ""I have to ask but for me Ibou was more that he was tired than it was an injury. With Trent, he had to come off. That's never a good sign. ""And from what I heard from people that saw the images or how he got injured, that didn't look very good. So I would be surprised if he is available for Sunday."""
3/17/2025,08:02,'Nunez was probably not the right option',"Former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock believes that the pressure of taking a Champions League penalty got to striker Darwin Nunez, as the Uruguayan missed his spot-kick in Tuesday's shootout defeat to Paris St-Germain. Liverpool wereeliminated from the competition, with Nunez and Curtis Jones both being denied by Gianluigi Donnarumma, and Warnock says you could tell there was nervousness around Nunez's effort in particular. ""You could feel it as soon as he was walking forward,"" he said on theFootball Daily podcast. ""There was a sense of 'oh no,' and he was probably not the right option. ""To be honest, I am not going to say anything about anyone who takes a penalty, all credit to them, but I get what you mean. It's that confidence when you are stepping up. It is just one of those situations. ""I am sat here thinking, wow, look at the size of Donnarumma. If he dives the right way, he has a great chance of saving it."""
3/17/2025,07:58,'This was the work of someone trying too hard',"Liverpool's support, as they always have, stood firmly behind Darwin Nunez but he suffered a nightmare with an undistinguished performance as a substitute before missing a penalty in the shootout. There was no question about his work-rate here, but this was a confused, over-anxious display characterised by misplaced passes and misunderstandings after he replaced Diogo Jota with 17 minutes left of normal time. If anything, this was the work of someone trying too hard. It will, however, only increase the question marks about whether it will ever fall into place for a striker who earned a reputation as ""Captain Chaos"" for his all-action style but simply does not produce with the consistency to meet Liverpool's demands. Nunez, it should be stressed, was certainly not to blame for Liverpool's loss and the greats can miss penalties, but it was his miss that felt as it if carried more weight. He is likely to have plenty of chances to turn his fortunes around, perhaps starting against Newcastle United in Sunday's Carabao Cup final, but there is an inescapable sense that his future is likely to be on the agenda in the summer when Slot's tenure moves into its next phase, almost certainly with a Premier League title to defend.

3/17/2025,23:51,Liverpool exit at hands of PSG 'will hurt deeply',"Liverpool players slumped to the turf in disappointment as the fates and fortunes of the Champions League were illustrated in this thrilling last-16 tie that provoked all the emotions on a classic European night at Anfield. Arne Slot's side have barely broken stride as they topped the Champions League table and raced 15 points clear in the Premier League - but this is the biggest setback Liverpool and their Dutch coach have suffered this season. Ironically, Liverpool played much better in defeat at Anfield then they did when winning in the Parc des Princes in the first leg, but that was no consolation as this time luck did not smile on them as they were denied by the woodwork and then on penalties, when Donnarumma's expertise came to the fore. And most of all, they were frustrated by a top-class PSG side who are shaping up as potential Champions League winners. Anfield provided its usual thunderous atmosphere but Liverpool could not quite deliver, looking leggy and second best in the added 30 minutes. Liverpool will need to recover swiftly, with the Carabao Cup final againstNewcastle Unitedat Wembley on Sunday, but this was a defeat that will hurt deeply as they would have had Champions League expectations far beyond the last 16."
3/17/2025,23:38,'It feels unfair to go out at this round already' - Slot,"Liverpool manager Arne Slot, speaking to Amazon Prime:""It was the best game of football where I was ever involved in. Incredible performance, especially compared to last week. ""First 20-25 minutes, we were all over them, created chance after chance and all of a sudden we were 1-0 down. Probably it was almost the opposite [to first leg], maybe we ran out of luck because the margins were so small tonight. ""After 90 minutes it felt we deserved more than being 1-0 down. I was waiting for us to score. I don't think the second half, apart from the last five minutes, when they threatened us once or twice. We played the perfect game except from scoring goals, it was the same for PSG last week when they played the perfect game and didn't score and it happened to us today. ""It's always difficult if you put so much effort in, for the first 25 minutes I've never seen them so aggressive and so intense as they were today, and then you look at the scoreboard and you're 1-0 down, an unlucky goal as well. When you put in so much effort, that's sometimes difficult and in the end it comes down to penalties and we, as Dutch, know how to lose [on penalties]. ""It had everything you'd like to see from a football game. From a Liverpool perspective, you'd at least like to have a draw after 90 minutes but it came down to penalties. ""It feels unfair to go out at this round already, you're at the top of the table then you face a team like PSG, but that's also the nice part about football. Everybody around the world enjoyed watching this game and the margins are small, and if you want to win it you have to have some luck, we had it last week, I don't think we had it today. ""Now its clear what we have to do for the rest of the season, one league cup final and nine Premier League games to go."""
3/17/2025,23:34,'We always bounce back',"Liverpool full-back Andy Robertson, speaking to Amazon Prime:""That's the competition. You know, we got the win last week without playing our best. ""Can't question the effort or endeavour and everything we put into the game. ""When it goes to penalties, its's always a lottery. ""I can't be any prouder of the players. It's unfortunate that the effort wasn't rewarded. ""Last week a lot was said about them not taking their chances and we didn't take our chances [tonight]. ""We couldn't get back on level terms. We have got to look back on and there will be a lot of positives from this game, but a massive disappointment to not go through. ""Finishing top of the group and got the toughest tie of the whole Champions League. ""If they play to that level they should go far in the competition. ""It wasn't meant to be and we need to dust ourselves down. ""We always bounce back, there's a lot of tired legs in there. Cup finals, we enjoy them, and that's the biggest game."""
3/17/2025,23:16,'We're out of the competition - that is the reality',"Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk, speaking to Amazon Prime:""It was a very intense, great game of football, I think to be part of it as well. ""It was totally there for Liverpool and what we showed in Paris and unfortunately we're out on penalties and that is the reality. ""I think in the first half we created dangerous moments and they have the quality as well, and then it comes down to penalties. ""It's part of football, I said to the guys, obviously, you can be disappointed because we're out of the competition, but chin up and get ready for the next challenge, a beautiful one on the weekend. ""I think we were pretty good today as well, and you want to go as far as possible, but we knew when we drew PSG it was going to be very difficult. We saw in Paris when we struggled but we won, and today we saw a very good Liverpool side but we're out of the competition.

3/17/2025,10:38,Give it a rest...,"Southamptonbeing 1-0 up against Liverpool at half-time was arguably the best thing that could have happened to Arne Slot's side, it certainly added to the entertainment. With all the other teams knocking each other out beneath the champions elect, and the Reds a goal up against PSG in the Champions League with the second leg at home, there was at least the theoretical danger of some complacency setting in.‌ Slot was all over the team after a less than energetic first 45 minutes, making three substitutions as early as half time and he clearly had a go at the group in the dressing room during the interval. He wouldn't let it lie post-match either. He underlined that the intensity, high energy and going ""all in"" for every game is non-negotiable for him. These are the words of a winner but it is also very tough on players during such a heavy schedule. Their work rate in Paris during the week was exceptional and some players will have to manage their fitness levels for some huge fixtures to come, they are only human no matter how much you pay them. Mohamed Salah certainly knows how to rest in games and thank goodness he does.‌ Slot at one point said that he ""didn't want his players to conserve energy"", which is the first time I reckon I have not been fully onside with the Dutchman. Jurgen Klopp used to say just that in the early days at Anfield, but it soon leads to burnout. You have to have some awareness, especially with players in their thirties, but then again maybe this is why certain stars haven't yet been given those new long-term contracts.

Here are the key lines from his news conference: Slot confirmed Cody Gakpo ""will be fit to be in the squad"" having trained for the first time on Monday. On comments made by PSG boss Luis Enrique about his Ligue 1 side having nothing to lose: ""They have a game of football to lose. We do as well. I do think they have been at this stage of tournament for many years. Last season they reached the semi-finals - we were not even in this competition last year! The season before, this was the round we were knocked out. These teams [like PSG] are normally going quite far into Europe."" On what Liverpool need to improve after their first-leg performance: ""Some said we played poorly – I don't agree. I think they [PSG] played tremendously well. I don't think we have played a team this season that has combined that much quality with that much intensity, but I do think we can do better. I'm not saying we played poorly but we are a better team than we were last week. We need to prove that tomorrow with the help of our fans."" Slot does not believe that suggestions PSG were surprised by Liverpool's level last week will give his players extra motivation: ""I don't think anyone needs more motivation. Not our players or theirs. If you play in knockout stages at Anfield with one of best teams in Europe - them and us - no-one needs any kind of motivation."" Asked if this kind of week with big games is what made him want to be Reds boss, he said: ""There are many reasons why I wanted to be Liverpool manager. First of all, because of the history; second, because of the quality of players and third, because you expect us to be in these kind of moments. You want to compete for every trophy and at this club you expect to do so."" The head coach said ""you don't dream at all"" in a week like this and his only focus is to ""prepare the team in the best way"". He added: ""When you have games like last week you wonder: 'Do I even go to sleep or do I have to watch more?'"" On having a lead to defend: ""Is it different? No. We play every game to try and win. We tried to do that last week. It wasn't our intention to be low all the time. We tried to play a different game to over there, but sometimes teams, with the help of fans, that [performance] happens.

3/17/2025,15:04,Liverpool's 'all-round package' in midfield,"Alexis Mac Allister has been the most unheralded of Liverpool's three starting midfielders this season, but he is perhaps the most important. Arne Slot rested him againstSouthampton, and the Reds put in a pitiful first-half performance that saw them 1-0 down against the worst side in the Premier League. But everything changed when Mac Allister came on at half-time and within 10 minutes Liverpool had scored twice and the match was effectively won. He passes the ball through the lines at will, enabling Liverpool to transition more quickly and get his attackers on the half-turn. Before his entrance, all the passes into the forwards went to their feet when they were static, so it was too easy for Southampton to defend. Mac Allister gets stuck in, too. He tackles, presses and his positioning is exceptional. He really is the all-round package in terms of a progressive central midfielder. Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai looked tired against Southampton, but it is no surprise - they have barely had a rest all season. Slot will use those two and Mac Allister against PSG in the Champions League andNewcastle Unitedin the League Cup final. Let's hope they can get through it before the international break. By then, Liverpool may have two trophies wrapped up and be in the quarters of the Champions League - in hope of a potential treble. Find more from Jordan Chamberlain atEmpire of the Kop, external"

Arne Slot's side go into the second leg with a 1-0 advantage, thanks toHarvey Elliott's 87th-minute winnerat Parc des Princes last week, and will be hoping for a similar result to see them progress to the quarter-finals of the competition. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside ahead of the second leg at Anfield on Tuesday night, Robertson said: ""I think they have shown how good they can be. They are probably the best team we have played this season. ""We have got the lead, which is important, but we can obviously play better than what we did in the first leg and that is clear. We will have to play better because we can't rely on Alisson playing the game of his life every game. ""Hopefully the crowd can get behind us, like they usually do on Champions League nights, and hopefully we can get through. ""That's the aim but we have to play a lot better than we did against Southampton in the league and probably the whole 90 minutes against PSG [in the first leg]. We need to play better, there is no denying that. ""We have to be a little bit more front-footed and things like that, but the game plan will be clear.

They thought the goals would just mount up very easily. If you hadn't scored first this match could well have finished a goalless draw. Second half, Liverpool were more Champions elect.

3/17/2025,11:11,Sutton's predictions: Liverpool v Southampton,"I am at this game for BBC Radio 5 Live and I would not be surprised if Liverpool make quite a few changes. They have got a big lead at the top of the Premier League but they still have work to do in the Champions League against Paris St-Germain next week. They got a great win in the first leg in Paris, but that tie certainly isn't over. If Reds boss Arne Slot had a third team, he might think about using it here - but he can probably get away with playing his second team and still being too strong for Saints. It is around 230 miles from Southampton to Liverpool, and fair play to any Saints fans who make the trip - they are absolute die-hards because they are not getting anything at Anfield. I would be saving my petrol money, because they know they are getting beaten, same as they know they are getting relegated this season.

3/17/2025,18:35,Slot not taking Southampton 'final' lightly,"Top-of-the-table Liverpool may be playing bottom clubSouthamptonat Anfield on Saturday but Reds manager Arne Slot is not taking the game lightly. The Dutchman has described the match as the first of three finals in a week in which his side host Paris St-Germain in the second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie on Tuesday and then faceNewcastle Unitedin the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday, 16 March. ""A week to look forward to for every Liverpool fan,"" said Slot, who will serve the second game of a two-match touchline ban against Southampton. ""I know the final is there and everybody is already talking to me about how the atmosphere will be on a Champions League night, but I truly hope that our fans will be loudest tomorrow - not in the final and not against PSG, but tomorrow."" A win over Southampton will move Premier League leaders Liverpool 16 points clear of second-placedArsenal,whose two games in hand will be againstManchester Unitedon Sunday andChelseaa week later. Slot is using the word final for Saturday's game to emphasise its importance to both his players and the fans. ""I have to convince my players that we play three finals, like I said now a few times,"" added Slot. ""I'm hoping - and that's why every time come up with the word 'final' - that I influence our fans a bit as well. ""I'm hoping they will not come into the stadium five minutes before the kick-off. I'm hoping the whole stadium is already completely filled half an hour before kick-off."""
3/17/2025,18:34,'You have to bring top performances' - Slot,"This video can not be played  Liverpool boss Arne Slot spoke highly of Alisson during his latest news conference. He is pleased with the depth of the goalkeeper union, but said the Brazilian goalkeeper doesn't need strong competition to stay motivated, stating: ""He is a top professional like all of the players we have here. They know what it means to wear this shirt - you have to bring top performances or you won't play for this club."""
3/17/2025,16:51,'There's no other stopper in world football as gifted',"When Plato theorised about his world of Forms many centuries before Christ, he wasn't to know his weighty philosophical musings would one day be exhumed in an email newsletter to describe a silly little football match. But here I am, hoping my secondary school philosophy teacher will one day read this and know I actually was listening, struggling to think of a better way to describe Liverpool's 1-0 victory over Paris St-Germain. The only way I can is to understand it as a smash-and-grab of such Platonic perfection that it belongs among the great thinker's higher realm of Ideals. Plato posited all that we see on Earth today is merely an imperfect copy of that which exists in its true form, its perfect form, somewhere beyond the physical. But if he were alive today and signed up to whichever Greek subscription channel broadcasts the Champions League, he will have seen a goalkeeping performance to make him consider tearing up his papyrus scroll. To pull off such a footballing heist requires magnificence from the man between the sticks - and Alisson duly delivered for his side in the French capital. ""It was probably the performance of my life,"" he said after the game, before being hailed as ""the best in the world"" by Liverpool's late goalscoring hero Harvey Elliott. On Wednesday's evidence, it's impossible to disagree with the youngster. Alisson has only won one Yashin Trophy - the annual award given out since 2019 to the best goalkeeper on the planet - but for my money, there's no other stopper in world football as gifted with both hands and feet. Sign up for the Football Extra newsletter The latter were rarely used at the Parc des Prince though, this was a performance that needed hands alone - and multiple pairs, ideally. Alisson made nine saves throughout the contest, the most a Liverpool goalkeeper has made in a single game logged by data site Stathead for at least a decade. Those chances were of decent standard too, Les Parisiens' 27 total shots worthy of a combined 1.6 expected goals during 90 minutes of near-complete dominance. Liverpool had just 30% possession and took only two shots - both season-low tallies by a distance. To take the conversation to even nerdier heights, we can use Stathead's post-shot expected goals metric to illustrate the quality of PSG's shots on target during the contest. Where xG values the chance at the point of the shot being taken, PSxG shows how likely a shot is to go in after it has been kicked based on where it goes on goal. A powerful shot low to the corner has a high post-shot xG, while a weak shot at the keeper has a low one and a shot off target would return 0. By this metric, the stats say Alisson's acrobatics actually prevented 2.3 goals, the most-influential goalkeeping performance of the last decade in which Liverpool have kept a clean sheet, according to Stathead's logs. For all the Brazilian keeper's brilliance, the chips still need to fall your way to win a game in the manner Liverpool managed. All supporters, myself included, can find it tough to acknowledge luck's role in victory, as if in doing so it makes the final result less valid. However Reds boss Arne Slot had no hesitation pointing out his side were smiled upon by the footballing gods, admitting: ""Had we got a draw, we would still have been the lucky ones. They were much the better team today."" With the tie poised deliciously ahead of next week's return leg at Anfield, Slot will know that big improvements are needed to keep their course to the quarter-finals steady. For now though, Liverpool can savour a famous European victory. On nights like this, when luck and skill collide, even Plato would admit that the shadows on the cave wall aren't bad to look at after all."
3/17/2025,10:30,"Slot on getting 'lucky' against PSG, Alisson and managing his squad","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game againstSouthamptonat Anfield (kick-off 15:00 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Cody Gakpo has not yet trained with the squad as he still had ""a bit of pain"" yesterday, so it will ""be a close call"" if he can join in Friday's session. He said he ""might start the same 11"" against Southampton as he did against Paris St-Germain but because they ""had to fight really hard"" on Wednesday there could be changes. On getting ""a little bit lucky"" against PSG: ""We weren't a little bit lucky, we were really lucky! But as Michael Jordan said once: 'The harder you work, the luckier you get.'"" He said the result showed ""how mentally and physically strong"" his squad are because they ""were not the dominant team"" but scored on a counter-attack. On what sets Alisson apart as a goalkeeper: ""Saving shots! No, I think to become the best goalkeeper in the world you sometimes need to make saves others wouldn't make. I think he made one or two on Wednesday. He had two world-class saves in big moments for us."" He said his ""full focus is now on Southampton"" as it is ""the first of three finals for the upcoming week"". On the Saints: ""They are not playing as a team who are bottom of the league because they take risks, go man-to-man and they saw how difficult we had it with that gameplan against PSG. If you are not sharp or you aren't aggressive enough then they can hurt you."" He said some of his players ""don't get the time they deserve"" on the pitch and Harvey Elliott ""is a good example"" of that because ""he is competition with [Mohamed] Salah and [Dominik] Szoboszlai"".

3/17/2025,08:56,Slot focus returns to Premier League,"Arne Slot might still be wondering how his Liverpool side escaped with a 1-0 win over Paris St-Germain on Wednesday, but the main focus of his attention will have switched back to Premier League issues following the game at the Parc des Princes. The Reds hostSouthamptonon Saturday in what is their only top-flight game in March. A win will move Liverpool 16 points clear at the top of the Premier League and pile the pressure on second-placedArsenalto win their two games in hand againstManchester Unitedon Sunday andChelseaa week later. Slot will be speaking to the media at 10:00 GMT before the Reds host Saints, who are bottom of the table, and it will be interesting to hear what the Dutchman's thoughts are on his team selection. Does his side's advantage at the top of the Premier League mean he could choose to rotate some of his players before the return leg against PSG at Anfield on Tuesday? Cody Gakpo travelled to Paris in midweek but missed the game after picking up a knock in training, so we will also find out where the forward is up to fitness-wise. The game against Southampton will be the second of Slot's two-game touchline ban for the red card he picked up in the aftermath of the 2-2 draw atEverton,meaning he will be back in the dugout for the Carabao Cup final againstNewcastle Unitedon Sunday, 16 March.

3/17/2025,08:36,'I want to play but I need to respect the situation',"Harvey Elliott admits there are moments he gets ""angry and frustrated"" at his lack of game time for Liverpool. The 21-year-old scored with his first touch against Paris St-Germain on Wednesday after coming off the bench in the 86th minute. ""I'm still young - it's a hard thing to understand in my head really,"" he said. ""I've played nearly 150 games for Liverpool and I feel like I'm very experienced in terms of that aspect. There are moments within the season where I am getting angry and frustrated because I want to play but at the same time I need to respect the situation. I need to respect the manager's decisions. ""Some games I'm needed, some games I'm not - that's just how football is. That's why I feel like we're in the position we are in this season because of his decisions."" Elliott has started only four games this season in all competitions and made 18 appearances overall. ""As a player you always need to stay composed,"" he said. ""Football is full of ups and downs. ""You can go periods of time without playing - it's just about staying motivated and mentally right in the head. ""Moments like [Paris St-Germain] keep me motivated and the hunger is still within me to go out and show what I can do."""

3/17/2025,17:50,An alternative approach for big tests,"Gravenberch (38) and Mac Allister (10) received only 11 passes from Liverpool's defenders or keeper in the win at PSG. All of them went to Mac Allister. There are many ways to win a football match - and Liverpool seem to be exploring some alternatives. For Wednesday's late triumph in Paris, the Reds spent large spells on the backfoot, creating occasional promising breakaways but almost entirely lacking care when countering. In some ways, their defensive stance mirrored the 2-0 win atManchester Cityon 23 February, with Arne Slot's side being more clinical and nurturing of the ball when picking their moments at the Etihad. Consider this: Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister, Liverpool's two deepest midfielders, received a total of 11 passes from the entire back four and goalkeeper in Paris - and all of them went to Mac Allister. That means the role of a traditionally deep-lying midfielder to receive the ball off the defenders or the keeper completely bypassed Gravenberch as he did not receive a single pass from the five men behind him on the night. Such a move seems like sacrilege for those brought up on a diet of Didier Deschamps, Claude Makelele or - if you're a red - Dietmar Hamann. So why did it happen? Was the PSG press too suffocating for Liverpool to use their playmaking midfielders? Or is this an alternative way to tackle a football match? At City, Mac Allister and Gravenberch received a total of nine passes from defenders. All of them were given by the full-backs, with Alisson, Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate not playing a single ball into the midfield duo. Contrast these two fixtures with the 2-0 home win overNewcastlethat took place between them on 26 February (below graphic). Liverpool's backline played 44 passes into Mac Allister and Gravenberch. That's more than four times the number sent into the midfield frenzy during these past two away matches. So, while PSG's press was impressive, it seems apparent Slot wants his side to play with less risk on the ball in key areas - notably centrally - in these big away tests. Instead, his aim is to move the ball up the pitch swiftly, bypassing midfield, as they did expertly for Harvey Elliott's late winner. It is a tactic - or the applying of a handbrake - to watch out for and shows once again that there are many ways to win a football match. Mac Allister (10) and Gravenberch (38) received 44 passes from defenders against Newcastle."
3/17/2025,16:32,The verdict on Elliott's future,"After his crucial goal against Paris St-Germain, we asked for you what you think the future holds for Harvey Elliott. Here are some of your comments: Jimmy:Harvey Elliott is definitely a keeper. He is more than an impact player. He reads the game and has more creativity than anyone else in the squad. But, he doesn't fit into current team as he throws the balance, especially with Mo and Trent on the right. Next season might be different? Mark:Still a squad player but with more involvement than he's had so far. If Liverpool want to go far in multiple competitions, then they need their squad to be sharp and match-ready. Archie:Harvey is a great talent and we are lucky to have him! He never complains about his lack of game time and he always has a positive impact when he comes on. Nath:Harvey Elliott has had a tough season not getting the game time he would've been hoping for. But at 21, with the number of games he already has for Liverpool under his belt and again showing he's able to make an impact, it's only a matter of time before he's a trusted regular for Slot. Paul:I would love for him to stay and fight for the number-10 spot but it seems Slot doesn't value him too highly and unfortunately will be sold. After watching the Amazon documentary on Klopp and seeing Elliott's parents and upbringing, I love him even more! Would be a sad way to end things."
3/17/2025,14:44,'PSG caused Liverpool the most problems this season',"Former Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast about the Reds' win in Paris and the quality Paris Saint-Germain showed. On PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma being beaten late on by Harvey Elliott's finish, Westerveld said: ""He got a hand to it and I think it touched the inside of the post. As a goalkeeper, you feel that you should have done a little bit more and gone with a stronger hand so I really felt sorry for him. ""Paris Saint-Germain must have been walking off the pitch feeling sorry for themselves. But they have an unbelievable side and they caused Liverpool the most problems this season."" The home side had 27 shots in this match – the second-most on record (from 2003-04) for a side in a Champions League knockout match in which they both failed to score and lost, behind only PSG themselves v Borussia Dortmund in May 2024 (30). ""They will play the same next week so Liverpool really has to step up and play differently because otherwise they can still beat Liverpool even 4-0 at Anfield,"" Westerveld added."

3/17/2025,10:24,A tale of two touch maps,"Only full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold (45) and Andrew Robertson (54) had more touches for Liverpool than Alisson (44) in Wednesday's win over Paris St-Germain. Six of these came outside the penalty area. Former Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger, speaking on Champions League Match of the Day: ""If they [Liverpool] go through to the next round, they have to thank Alisson Becker because tonight he gave an unbelievable performance. I'm looking forward to the second leg and wondering how PSG are going to recover from it, because they were the much better team and yet they didn't get anything out of this game. ""I doubt Alisson is going to have another night like tonight because this was exceptional. We've seen performances like this before, but they don't happen regularly."" Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha: ""You want people coming off the bench to make a difference and, I'll be honest, when I'm seeing Mohamed Salah coming off for Harvey Elliott, I'm thinking it's probably not the most progressive substitution. ""But, the fact is the manager trusts him and he knows this is a moment to go out and work as hard as you can for the team and that's what he does. ""It's a fantastic moment for him, and for Darwin Nunez as well setting up the goal. That's what you need at times when you are suffering as a team, you're just hoping for a moment and then, if it does come, can you take it?"""
3/17/2025,08:42,'I expect Liverpool to force PSG to not play their game in second leg',"French football journalist Julien Laurens says Paris St-Germain will ""go for it"" at Anfield after dominating Wednesday's Champions League round of 16 first leg against Liverpool despite a 1-0 defeat. The French champions had 27 shots in the match - the second-most on record by a side in a Champions League knockout match in which they both failed to score and lost. ""This PSG team only plays one way home or away,"" Laurens told the Football Daily podcast. ""You can force them to play long because they can't get out of your press and make it difficult but they will always try and play. ""There were times I didn't really recognise the Liverpool team we have seen this season. Virgil van Dijk, the best defender in the world, doesn't time waste after 15 minutes, he doesn't often play that long. It's not often Mohammed Salah is that anonymous. PSG forced them to play like that."" Visiting Anfield next week will be a different proposition for Luis Enrique's side, and Laurens believes the Reds can disrupt their opponents in a similar way to what was done to them. ""I expect Liverpool to do the same next week to Paris and force them to not play their game,"" he added. ""Liverpool will be in their faces and they also have a lead. They can't attack all the time and leave space in behind. ""The way both teams approach the game will be really interesting. For PSG they have to go for it. They might lose 3-1 for it because they will give Liverpool spaces, they will attack and try and play in their half like they did in Paris. ""It is much more difficult to do away from home, especially in Liverpool, and they might pay for it but they will go for it for sure."" Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds"

Big night for Alisson and Elliott with his first touch. You've got to believe anything is possible now. Karen:Stunning game. Alisson deservedly man of the match. Robust performance by PSG but could not break Liverpool. Well done LFC! Onwards we go. Another great European win. Christian:The longer that game went without a PSG goal, the more it felt probable Liverpool would snatch it.

Ray:""Lucky lucky Liverpool"" is what everyone will be saying but who cares? Get in. Normally we are saying ""what an attacking performance"". This time it's ""what a goalkeeping performance"". Well done Alisson Becker. Sam:Never seen Liverpool get dominated like that, Alisson was unreal. Anfield will be a different story.

The awareness of what's around him and how to deal with situations is amazing. ""His decision-making his exceptional. He doesn't come out into a crowd really and try and catch things because he's probably not as tall as most other goalkeepers. ""His punching and distribution is phenomenal but for me it's those one-v-one situations.

""I said before the game that we would not dominate ball possession over here. The only thing I can blame my players for is that four, five or six times we tried to play through them and it was completely open and the last touch should be better.

The Premier League leaders and Carabao Cup finalists are usually the team punishing the opposition but for the first time they were blown away - in every aspect bar the scoreline. Brazil goalkeeper Alisson was the reason they came away from the French capital still in the tie. He pulled off sensational saves, nine in total, to deny a host of PSG players including Ousmane Dembele (twice), Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (four times) and substitute Desire Doue (twice). The visitors had managed precisely one shot before the goal, Luis Diaz's off-target effort in the 44th minute. But Harvey Elliott stunned the hosts 46 seconds after coming off the bench to replace top scorer Mohamed Salah, who had a rare quiet night. Alisson played a long ball up to Darwin Nunez, who controlled the ball and picked out Elliott in space. Gianluigi Donnarumma got a touch to his first-time strike but could not stop it settling in the bottom corner.

3/17/2025,16:29,Things for Liverpool to watch out for in Paris,"The all-conquering form of a rejuvenated Paris St-Germain would have seemed unlikely at the start of the season. Portugal international Goncalo Ramos was sidelined for three months with an ankle injury, while Randal Kolo Muani was progressively phased out of the team, eventually culminating in his loan move to Juventus this winter. Initially, it was Bradley Barcola, from the left wing, who took up the mantle by scoring 10 times in the first 11 league games of the campaign. Having carried over his goalscoring form to international duty amid Kylian Mbappe's absence from Les Bleus, the 22-year-old was looking increasingly at ease in carrying the now-Real Madrid man's responsibilities for club and country. His form only faintly translated to Champions League fixtures, though, as was the case for the rest of the team. Successive false-nine experiments, notably involving Kang-in Lee and Ousmane Dembele, were proving mostly ineffective as the team registered just one win in the first five European matchdays. The team's league stage campaign, branded by manager Luis Enrique as ""unjust"" given the tough draw they faced, was stunted by an inability to capitalise on their dominance in possession in most games. A disastrous early exit in January was an increasingly credible prospect, until the pieces of the Spaniard's plan finally began to fall into place. PSG's free-scoring run since January has included 18 goals in four European encounters, a figure admittedly inflated by Brest's unfortunate collapse in their play-off tie. Read the full feature"

Here are the key lines from his news conference: Cody Gakpo has travelled with the squad but Slot said he will be assessed before Wednesday's game: ""He was close to being ready to play again, but unfortunately on Monday he had to block a shot and felt a bit of pain again. We will judge how he is on Wednesday and if he can be part of the squad, but it will be a close call."" Asked about the written reasons for his two-match touchline ban, stemming from his red card after the draw againstEverton,being published by the Football Association on Tuesday: ""The moment it happened, I was quite emotional. I chose to go on the pitch instead of staying calm, staying inside and then talking to Michael [Oliver, referee]. Now, I don't have those same emotions any more so I think I should set a better example than I set back then and not go into the situation again."" Slot said he sees PSG as ""one of the strongest teams in Europe"" and added: ""It's a great fixture to look forward to for everyone who loves football. Both teams have scored so many goals this season. They have quite similar playing styles."" He continued: ""Luis Enrique has done a lot of things really well over the past one and a half seasons. I assume he is happy with what he has created, not only a team performance but also individual performances. The quality [Ousmane] Dembele brings to the team is impressive. It's clear he's done a great job. They got to the Champions League semi-final last season and, in my opinion, this team is better than the one he managed last season.""

3/17/2025,16:07,Why Slot got a touchline ban,"The Football Association has published its written reasons for thetwo-match touchline ban and £70,000 finethat Liverpool boss Arne Slot received following his red card at the end ofEverton's 2-2 draw with Liverpoolon 12 February. Reds assistant Sipke Hulshoff was banned from the touchline for two games and fined £7,000, while Liverpool and Everton were fined £65,000 and £50,000 respectively for failing to control their players. What is Slot alleged to have said? While shaking the hand of referee Michael Oliver, the report alleges that Slot used abusive words towards Oliver. Slot is alleged to have said to Oliver that he ""[expletive] gave them everything"" in relation to Everton. It also alleged that Slot said to Oliver that he hoped he was ""proud of that performance"". Slot is also stated to have said ""if we don't win the league, I'll [expletive] blame you"" before shouting ""a [expletive] disgrace"" twice at Oliver. What does Slot claim he said? Slot has disputed the FA's reasons for the punishment. In response to his alleged comments towards Oliver, Slot states that he actually said ""if we don't win the league, I will have you to thank for that"". What did Hulshoff say? Hulshoff has also been alleged to have entered the field of play at full-time in an ""extremely aggressive manner"". He was also alleged to have made comments to Oliver, including that the referee was ""[expletive] [expletive]"" and ""gave them everything"" in relation to Everton and that was a ""[expletive] disgrace"". Hulshoff was later alleged to have followed Oliver, continuing to shout ""[expletive] [expletive]"" at Oliver before the referee sent him off. What has Slot said in the aftermath? At a news conference last month, Slot said: ""Emotions got the better of me.

3/17/2025,15:09,'We must have the ball more than Liverpool' - Enrique,"Paris St-Germain boss Luis Enrique has stressed his team ""must have the ball"" more than Liverpool if they are to emerge from Wednesday's Champions League round of 16 first leg with a positive result. The French Champions are in great form, scoring 21 goals in their past four games and sitting 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1. ""There are some differences between the two teams,"" Enrique said in his pre-match news conference. ""Liverpool want to attack, but we need the ball. ""They maybe don't need the ball as much to impose their game. Each manager tries to do his best. ""We must have the ball more than them and generate more chances and defend effectively, the same as in all the other matches. ""We're going to try to keep the ball and not suffer too much on the transitions. If we manage to impose our style of play, we'll manage not to suffer too much."" The Reds themselves arrive at the Parc des Princes in good form and know bringing a positive result back to Anfield will give them a strong platform for progression. However, Enrique does not believe the first leg will be decisive. ""The first match, I don't think it will define who will qualify but it's true that it's a very, very important match for us,"" he added. ""It's difficult for our opponents to play at the Parc with the pressure and the atmosphere. It's extraordinary. ""We are a collective, sometimes it is the substitutes who are the most important. Tomorrow, I could play four or five players and we would not see the difference. That is what makes us stronger. Everyone will have their role."""
3/17/2025,12:34,What next for Elliott and are Reds set for 'goalkeeper drama'?,"We asked for your views on one thing nobody is talking about at Liverpool but really should be. Here are some of your comments: Roger: What does the future hold for Harvey Elliott?  He is still very young but seems to have been around for years. Our midfield options appear much stronger now with the revelation of Gravenberch, Jones getting more games, and Chiesa's arrival. And we still have the likes of Bajcetic (currently on loan) to come back. Elliott needs a move if he wants to be an automatic pick I feel, although he would be a big miss if he left. Alan: Ticketing for home games is becoming more difficult for local/UK supporters and while many understand the need for 'new' money the traditional fans are what make Anfield the fortress it is. David: One thing not being talked about - Ben Doak. Already a Scotland international, currently on loan at Middlesbrough and doing very well. Also plays in the Salah position. Odd that he never gets mentioned in the context of the tediously endless discussion of Mo's contract. Pat: Nobody's speaking about the goalkeeper drama that is going to make or break next season. Mamardashvili, Alisson, Kelleher - we don't need all three. Presumably none of them want to be a number two. Personally I'd cash in on injury-prone Allison, as good as he is, and let the two younger men fight for the jersey. But, whatever the club decides, having three world class goalies is probably a recipe for disaster. Joe: Virgil van Dijk. I don't notice any significant difference in his performances this season compared to the 2018-19 season where many campaigned that he should have won the Ballon D'or, yet I also see very little conversation around how dependable he is. He is surely the most consistently brilliant player on the planet yet I would be surprised to see his name mentioned for the biggest individual prizes at the end of the season. Rhys: The most under-reported story of this season is the development of Quansah. From the start of the season he has really grown into the squad and is a solid centre-back for his age. If progress continues it won't be long until the young man is pushing for regular first team action. Josh: Wataru Endo. The closer. That's it. That's the message. Vardon: It's difficult to keep much hidden from press and Liverpool's £57m deficit, as recently reported will no doubt have tongues wagging regarding summer transfers. Our lead at the top of the Premier League in part disguises the need for major investment. The question is where does the money come from? FSG have been berated for may seasons regarding what is seen as a minimal spend in the market. Are they really to blame, or is football finally beginning to eat itself?"

3/17/2025,12:35,'He could captain the side for five more years at least',"Liverpool's players enjoyed a well-earned weekend off as FA Cup action took place, which means they will be raring to go against Paris St-Germain in the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday. The Reds exited the FA Cup in the fourth round atPlymouth, which was a reminder that no team can perform without their best players... Without Virgil van Dijk marshalling the side, the Reds looked lost defensively that afternoon, but he has been completely imperious in the Premier League in helping Liverpool to two clean sheets againstManchester CityandNewcastle Unitedthat moved us 13 points clear at the top. Mo Salah has been the best player in the country this season, but Van Dijk is second. Then third place is a long, long way back. While Salah is getting the plaudits and could win a Ballon d'Or, Van Dijk's brilliance is under-appreciated. In terms of ability, he is the best centre-back in modern football history. The only defenders to have played in the Premier League who could tie his boots were John Terry and Rio Ferdinand. Van Dijk is faster than both, stronger than both, a better passer, as good positionally and more composed. And all while playing in a line about 25 yards higher than those two had to. Against City and Newcastle, when Liverpool were 2-0 up, the Reds dropped their line and defended like a side in the mid-noughties. They did not park the bus, but they just shut up shop and ended the game as a contest. Van Dijk morphed into that old-style centre-back, heading everything away, making the occasional block and generally looking virtually impenetrable. Pay him what he wants, Liverpool. He could captain the side for five more years at least. Find more from Jordan Chamberlain atEmpire of the Kop, external"

3/17/2025,16:49,The moments that defined Origi,"Liverpool's Champions League semi-final second-leg comeback win over Barcelona in 2019 will go down as one of the greatest Anfield night in the club's history. With the Reds needing to overcome a 3-0 deficit from the first leg and missing key players like Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, it looked like a fait accompli before kick-off that Lionel Messi's Barca side would stride into the final. However, an aggressive press, a raucous crowd and goals from Divock Origi and substitute Georginio Wijnaldum left the Catalan side bewildered. In a new Amazon Prime documentary, Klopp reveals what he told his team before the game. ""We asked the players to close their eyes for 10 seconds and imagine the best game you've ever played in your life,"" he says. ""It can be a youth game, it can be when you were 10 years old. Then they opened their eyes again and I said: 'And that's exactly the performance we need again today'."" The win was sealed when Alexander-Arnold caught Barcelona napping and delivered a quick corner for Origi to guide home. Klopp reveals the whole thing happened so quickly that it passed him by. ""That moment I had no clue who took the corner,"" he says. ""That's the truth. I look around, Divock hits the ball and it goes into the net."" The Belgium striker became a cult Kop figure under Klopp, with a reputation for scoring important goals in big games, often as a substitute. In December 2018, he capitalised on an error byEvertonkeeper Jordan Pickford to nod in a winner in the 96th-minute of the Merseyside derby, sending the Kop into pandemonium and earning his manager a fine after the German sprinted onto the pitch to celebrate. However, former midfielder Adam Lallana claims in the documentary that the Origi had no idea at the time how significant his goal was. ""I remember looking at Divock and thinking: 'I'm not sure you know the score'.,I think he thought he equalised,"" says theSouthamptonmidfielder. Footage of the moment does show Origi running to retrieve the ball, as if to accelerate the restart. ""Divock was a little bit like that,"" says Lallana. ""At times, he was away with the fairies."""
3/17/2025,16:48,'Still so much to offer' - Lijnders' advice to Nunez,"Ever since signing for Liverpool in the summer of 2022 for an initial £64m, Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez has been under scrutiny. The 25-year-old registered 11 Premier League goals and eight assists last season, with much conversation around some of the chances he missed. ""With social media and how the world is now, these players go through moments when it's like the whole world has an opinion,"" says former Liverpool assistant manager Pep Lijnders in a new Amazon Prime documentary. ""For players nowadays, it's really important that that cannot take the confidence away."" In a filmed conversation between the Dutch coach and Nunez, Lijnders tells the striker: ""Some players are just about scoring, but you're becoming more and more of an assist-provider, but I still think you've got so much to offer."""
3/17/2025,11:55,Alexander-Arnold - Ball winner? Risk taker? Creative force?,"Which Liverpool player has won possession the most times this season? Ryan Gravenberch would be a popular and correct answer. His winning of the ball 146 times leads from a player who few would instinctively select. Second on the list - despite social media snippets and memes on how many times he has been dribbled past - is a certain Trent Alexander-Arnold. The full-back, so often derided for his defending, must be doing something right given he has regained possession on 118 occasions. That puts him ahead of scurrying midfielder Alexis Mac Allister (112) and the galloping Dominik Szobozslai (106). So where does the critical narrative come from? Alexander-Arnold, 26, is of course out of contract this summer. Wherever his future takes him, the 'dribbled past' label is one he could do with shaking off. Does it carry weight? In a word, yes. This season an opponent has gone past him 51 times. For Liverpool, Mac Allister sits second in that unwanted metric on 38, before a substantial drop. Bradley - who of course challenges Alexander-Arnold at right-back - has been passed seven times with a dribble. On top of that, according to Opta data, Alexander-Arnold has only won around 20% of his aerial duels, with Bradley at 71%. Ibrahima Konate (76%), Gravenberch (75%) and Virgil van Dijk (71%) stand well clear, with left-back Andy Robertson on a lowly (26%), much like Alexander-Arnold. When mapping the number of errors leading to a shot, Alexander-Arnold also tops the pile on four, two clear of captain Van Dijk. In truth, the data paints a confusing picture of a player who opposition teams seem to target. This allows him to win possession back a lot for the Reds but opens him up to a greater number of dribbles, errors and aerial challenges. It appears, from the numbers at least, he remains a defender under pressure. His manager, team-mates and a supportive fanbase will however continue to point to his attacking output. In a competition where Mohamed Salah has his own ball to play with at the top of the rankings, Alexander-Arnold has created the second highest number of chances and is also second for assists at Liverpool. He embodies risk and reward. The league table currently points to the Reds coming out on the right side of the equation."
3/17/2025,11:54,Lijnders told Klopp about Alexander-Arnold 'on day one',"One of the success stories of the Jurgen Klopp era at Liverpool is the development of Trent Alexander-Arnold from academy kid into one of the best attacking full-backs in the world, with the most Premier League assists of any defender in history. Klopp reveals in a new Amazon Prime documentary that former head of the under-18 academy Pep Lijnders instantly saw the 26-year-old's potential. ""I think on day one, Pep told me about Trent,"" he says. The defender has helped Liverpool lift the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Club World Cup and twice the League Cup. However, he says that his debut in 2016 – in a 2-1 win againstTottenham Hotspurin the fourth round of the EFL Cup – remains, ""the proudest moment I've had in football"". Reflecting on his achievements with his boyhood club, Alexander-Arnold says: ""I owe it to that six-year-old lad who walked through the academy gates the first day. I owe it to the teenager that never went to a party, was doing homework in the back of a bus from training. I owe it to him who sacrificed everything."" With the 26-year-old's contract at Liverpool due to expire this summer, there has been much speculation over whether the Reds have a potential successor in waiting in the shape of Northern Irish right-back, Conor Bradley. The 21-year-old, who has been at Liverpool's academy since he was a teen, made his debut in the Premier League last January under Klopp, in a 4-0 win overBournemouth, where he picked up an assist. Ten days later he scored his first goal for the Reds and provided two more assists in a 4-1 win againstChelsea- earning him the man of the match award - and he has continued to impress when asked to deputise for Alexander-Arnold this season. Lijnders also reveals in the documentary that he ""really fought"" for Bradley ""to be our number two behind Trent"". He also fell out with Klopp over the decision to send the youngster on loan to Bolton in 2022. ""I was really trying to keep him in the club, because I believed that he would be already ready that time,"" Lijnders adds. ""The club makes a decision together with Jurgen to get him out on loan and it really upset me a lot. That was probably one of the only confrontations I had with Jurgen."""

3/17/2025,13:44,How Szoboszlai's improvement has driven Liverpool towards title,"Dominik Szobozslai won possession back eight times for Liverpool in Wednesday's 2-0 win overNewcastle- a high for his team - as well as winning eight of his 10 duels. His coverage of the Anfield turf was comprehensive - tracking 10.9km, which was the furthest clocked by any player on the night. His endeavour in recent weeks has been obvious. Said to have contracted and been hampered by a virus late in 2024, this year, he has found his legs, his touch and the confidence that comes with such improvements. Not a Liverpool fan? Find and follow your club here Away from the gutsy effort, Szobozslai has added a finishing flourish to his game at the most critical of times. On this page on 17 January, we posted the graph below showing he was the only player in Liverpool's attacking arsenal to be significantly underperforming his expected goals. The powerhouse midfielder should have applied the finish to 4.31 goals and was floundering on just two, with two assists. Five weeks ago, Dominik Szoboszlai was the only Liverpool player underperforming their xG by a significant amount. For clarity, Szobozslai had recorded two goals and two assists in 18 Premier League outings at this point, with the Reds coming off a draw atNottingham Forest. In the eight league games since, he has scored three times and added a further assist. He also scored in the Carabao Cup semi-final win againstTottenham. He is still underperforming his current xG of 6.6 but the differential has narrowed, with him now on five league goals in total. Furthermore, his return to form and presence are key in a critical triangle in Arne Slot's team. On the graphic below, the thicker the line, the more passes a player plays or receives from a team-mate. Much has been made of Trent Alexander-Arnold's superb relationship with Mohamed Salah. Against Newcastle, the pair shared 22 passes. What perhaps goes underappreciated is how Szobozslai is the third cog in the system. In Wednesday's win, he shared 14 passes with Salah and the same number with Alexander-Arnold, making himself an integral link between two of Liverpool's most creative forces. From harassing opponents, winning the ball back (only Gravenberch, Alexander-Arnold and Mac Allister have won possession more for Liverpool this season) and adding goals in recent weeks, there can be no doubting Szobozslai's significance. The Kop has already started serenading the league title. Salah will rightly take the plaudits but the marauding Szobozslai has proven a driving force at a pivotal moment. The thicker the line, the more passes two players share. Szobozslai shared 14 passes with (11) Salah and the same amount with (66) Alexander-Arnold. The three are the most prolific combination between Liverpool's defence and attack."
3/17/2025,08:42,Liverpool 2-0 Newcastle - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your views on Liverpool'sPremier League matchagainstNewcastle. Here are some of your comments: Liverpool fans Yusuf:Excellent performance in all areas. Everyone looked like they wanted something to prove. Two very clean strikes from Dominic Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister. And just give Mohamed Salah his new contract - every time he delivers a cross with the outside of his boot is an extra £10,000 add-on bonus in waiting! David:This was the best-looking performance of the season. Fluid and intense. They look like champions all the way through. Stuart:Once it was apparent Alexander Isak wasn't playing, Liverpool nullified Newcastle with ease. They worked the ball so well and hardly broke a sweat. Salah smiled the entire game. Every player glided around the pitch. Once theArsenalresult filtered through to the players, they were very professional and closed the game out. Newcastle fans Krish:When you play at Anfield you need to take chances or make the keeper work and we couldn't do that. We limited Liverpool to only a few chances but there's a clear divide in quality without Isak, Joelinton and Sven Botman. We need positive performances ahead of the final Robert:Sadly it's going to be more than 70 years of winning a trophy in this country for Newcastle United. It seemed like men against boys. David:We never laid a glove on Liverpool. The tactics were sound, but when you give possession away whilst attacking probably the best side in Europe they will hurt you. Some of the fringe players look like they are going through the motions now. So a summer reshuffle must be on the cards in the summer to mount a sustainable top four challenge."

Statisticians Opta say it is 98.7% likely Liverpool will win the title (withArsenalon 1.3%). Liverpool are 13 points clear of Arsenal with 10 games to go - although the Gunners have 11 matches left. If the Reds maintain a 13-point lead, that will give them the title with four games to spare - on 26 April againstTottenham. But if the Gunners win their game in hand - and match their other results, Liverpool would seal the title the following weekend againstChelsea. If that happened, their first game as champions would be a home game against Arsenal, who may end up giving them a guard of honour on to the pitch. Because of their progress in the Champions League, a place in the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle and an international break, Liverpool only play one league game in March. The earliest that Liverpool could mathematically win the title would be in the first week of April. If the Reds won their next three games and Arsenal lost their next four matches (with teams below them dropping a few points too), it would be over on 5 April.

3/17/2025,23:25,'Still a long way to go',"Liverpool boss Arne Slot speaking, to TNT Sports on when he will think about the title: ""It is still a long way to go, ten games. In March we only play one Premier League game, then we have the cup final of course and an international break and then two big games against Paris Saint-Germain - so we are not focused on the long term. ""I know and the players know how difficult the Champions League game is going to be - they are in the same form as us, hardly lose. It is going to be a difficult task for both teams. ""Now the players have some days off and then we focus on PSG more than we do on the table in the Premier League."" On rest for the players: ""Yes it is true that rest is good but also I would love to play because the likes of [Harvey] Elliot, [Jarell] Quansah, [Federico] Chiesa would have been good for them to have a game, but for Virgil [Van Dijk] and Mo [Salah] and these players it is very good."" On beating Newcastle before the Carabao Cup final: ""I don't think that means so much because I saw a different Newcastle tonight than a few months ago. I don't know if that is for a reason. Normally they press in a 4-5-1 and today they did a 4-4-2 and Isak and Joelinton were not there. We can expect something different in a few weeks."""
3/17/2025,23:15,Liverpool 2-0 Newcastle: League leaders a class above,"Newcastle could have proved a tricky stumbling block for Arne Slot's Reds. After all, the Magpies had impressed with goal-heavy wins against Manchester City and Nottingham Forest of late, while they stopped Liverpool from taking all three points at St James' Park in December. Yet it turned out to be a rather comfortable evening out at Anfield. With an out-of-form Callum Wilson deputising for the absent Alexander Isak, and with Anthony Gordon far from his best, Liverpool's backline was rarely tested. After Alexis Mac Alister's goal, the victory never looked in doubt as Slot's side dominated possession and continued to push forward. And now, with a 13 point lead at the top of table, there will be even fewer doubters that Liverpool will get their hands on the Premier League trophy again. No team has ever squandered that in English top-flight history, and there are no signs of Liverpool - on a 24 match unbeaten run in the league - crumbling now."

3/17/2025,18:22,Previous Salah contract was 'a hard piece of work',"Liverpool's former director of research Ian Graham says he was ""surprised"" at what he discovered when Mohamed Salah last negotiated a new deal at Anfield. Graham helped work on the three-year contract in 2022 that saw then 30-year-old Salah extend his stay with the club until this summer. The 32-year-old is now in the final months of that contract with a new deal as yet unsigned, having scored 25 goals and provided 16 assists in a remarkable 27 Premier League games so far this season. ""At that time, I thought I would not recommend for players of his age to sign a contract,"" Graham told a Financial Times Business of Football summit. ""But, this was the strength of the data that forces you to take an objective viewpoint. It surprises you. ""I was surprised at looking at his calibre of player and how they could go into their 30s [still] performing at the same level. When those players drop off, it tends to be a drop in minutes rather than in quality. ""We decided to give him a contract in the summer of 2022 and that was a hard piece of work.

3/17/2025,14:02,'Liverpool will adapt without Slot - they always do',"Atwo-match touchline banfor Liverpool manager Arne Slot is far from ideal. His team have just established a double-digit points lead at the top of the Premier League table and look to be marching towards the title with ruthless efficiency. With the man who calls the shots being positioned up in the stands at Anfield for tonight's match with Newcastle, touchline responsibilities will handed to another key member of the management team. The coaching staff will have to adapt, but that's unlikely to be a problem. Liverpool have been adapting since the moment he walked through the door. Adapting the playing style to be less about demolishing teams with a mixture of power, pace and frenetic energy, and more about exerting authority in possession and taking fewer chances with their build-up play. Adapting the skillsets of Ryan Gravenberch and Cody Gakpo to suit the needs and requirements of this new-look team. Both struggled to hold down regular starting places until this season. They have now become pivotal parts of the team in different areas of the pitch. And yet it is how they coped with the match circumstances on Sunday and their opponent's strengths that was the real masterclass in adaptability. Slot used a system that catered forManchester City's much higher possession count, preventing Pep Guardiola's side capitalising on that because Liverpool's defensive shape without the ball just did not allow them to. City were smothered by a red tide, absorbing everything they tried to throw at Liverpool, before countering with a stunning simplicity and opening the City defence up with regularity. This evening,Newcastlefans will come to Anfield sensing that the one that really counts is when the two sides meet in 18 days at Wembley in the Carabao Cup final. But equally for Eddie Howe, Champions League football next season remains a realistic ambition while for Slot there is the knowledge that another win tonight may see them extend their lead at the top. Whatever happens, Liverpool will adapt. They always do.

3/17/2025,13:44,'Maturity' key for controlled Liverpool - Nevin,"We all love watching exciting, unpredictable football laced with a dash of that devil-may-care spirit that keeps us on the edge of our seats. Right now, that is exactly what the very top of the Premier League, isn't. This is no indictment of Liverpool or indeed their style, but a question about the also rans. This isn't the best group of teams in recent Premier League history, but it still shouldn't reflect negatively on Liverpool's achievements. Arne Slot's men seemed to manageManchester City2-0, rather than beat them 2-0 at the Etihad. That doesn't mean they aren't capable of being swashbuckling, it is just that they scarcely need to fully exert themselves that often. There is a maturity about their play and their game management is way ahead of anyone else. These are the reasons, along with the incomparable Mo Salah and Virgil van Dijk being at another level to anyone else around in their positions, why Liverpool are unlikely to stumble enough to be caught now. I understand why some Liverpool fans feel praise for their team has been muted, and they have a point, but football fans want that excitement and uncertainty in their league campaign. Remember that before this season's downfall, many were getting bored with Man City's crushing dominance, mostly because it was based on a predictable, ultra-controlled possession style. It was admired more than loved by the end. Don't worry about Liverpool however, they will be buckling their swash again by the end of the season, but it may take the latter stages of the Champions League for them to show exactly how exciting they can be.

3/17/2025,11:23,Sutton's predictions: Liverpool v Newcastle,"This fixture has plenty of history behind it - Liverpool's 4-3 win at Anfield in 1996 will always be remembered as a Premier League classic. Newcastle come into it in good shape after a good win overNottingham Forest, but the way Liverpool beatManchester Citywas extremely impressive. It was such a mature performance by Arne Slot's side to soak up City's possession and be so clinical in front of goal. We know by now that Slot's side will be hard to beat, while Newcastle are still quite up and down - they were very poor when they went to Etihad Stadium last week. They are capable of giving Liverpool a good game but I am going to say that the leaders will take the points and carry on their title charge. Along with Forest striker Chris 'The Wood Chopper' Wood, Newcastle's Alexander Isak has been one of the best players in the Premier League this season, but there is only one candidate to be crowned player of the year. Liverpool's Mohamed Salah's numbers are extraordinary and he looks as hungry as ever. He has been relentless, and he is not done yet. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Read the full predictions and have your say here"
3/17/2025,10:01,How Slot has 'helped Salah get to an even higher level',"Arne Slot did something extremely bold againstManchester City- and it worked. The Dutchman picked neither Diogo Jota nor Darwin Nunez at centre-forward, instead using Curtis Jones and Dom Szoboszlai as false-10s in a 4-2-4 formation. Luis Diaz went back to the left wing to give the Reds width and while the makeshift forwards pressed City's centre-backs relentlessly, they were creative too. Both Szoboszlai and Jones were involved in the two goals, but also teamed up to score another one that was ruled out for a narrow offside. In Slot's first pre-season game of the summer he used the same formation against Real Betis, but we have barely seen it since. It was a bold move to put so few bodies in central midfield, but Slot trusted the excellent Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister to control tempo and dominate. That is exactly what they did, and when the best player on planet earth, Mo Salah, is in his current vein of form, Liverpool looked unbeatable. Slot is proving himself a genius and has helped Salah get to an even higher level. The Egyptian sprints less but every time he gets the ball on the right he makes a good decision and then executes perfectly. He is completely in control of everything he is doing, and playing with complete composure and focus. At this rate, provided he stays and signs a new contract, Salah could actually go down as the best Premier League player of all time. Find more from Jordan Chamberlain atEmpire of the Kop, external"

""It's a good thing he is in the discussion because it means he and we are doing well. In general, someone who wins the Ballon d'Or needs to win something as well so it is a great challenge for us,"" Slot said. ""What I like is that he takes this challenge not only by scoring and assisting, but wanting the team to win with his defensive work-rate. His work-rate in the second half [againstManchester City] was outstanding. That is what it takes for us to have a chance of winning something."" This video can not be played "
3/17/2025,12:04,Rotation 'difficult' at this stage of season,"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot is reluctant to rotate his squad for Wednesday's home game againstNewcastleas they continue to lead the Premier League title race. Right-back Conor Bradley is the latest player to be sidelined, with Slot confirming in Tuesday's pre-match news conference that ""it will be weeks"" before the 21-year-old will be back in contention. That is in addition to fellow defender Joe Gomez, who is expected to miss almost all of the remainder of the season with a hamstring injury. Slot is optimistic midfielder Alexis Mac Allister will be ""OK"" for Wednesday's game - as long as he feels fine after Tuesday's training session - and Cody Gakpo's return is a big plus should Slot want to potentially reduce the workload of other forwards, including Mohamed Salah, at any point. When asked if he may freshen the side against the Magpies, Slot said: ""I'm not so sure. It is difficult because these players are trained for this and they are ready for this. ""They are in a certain rhythm and they have shown this season many times that they are able to do it. ""But it was the reason that I changed the line-up so drastically against Plymouth [in the FA Cup] because I don't think you can do this all season. ""You need once every four or five weeks, a normal week - and what I mean by a normal week is two games a week, not three games a week. ""Of course, it hurt us in the FA Cup but it also means that these players are now able to play five games in a row at the highest possible level."" Not a Liverpool fan?

3/17/2025,11:25,Bradley out for a 'few weeks' - Liverpool boss Slot,"Conor Bradley will remain sidelined for a ""few weeks"" with a muscle injury, according to Liverpool boss Arne Slot. The 21-year-old Northern Ireland defender was forced off during Liverpool's Premier League draw with Aston Villa on 19 February. Having missed the league leaders' win over Manchester City on Sunday, Slot was unable to provide a timeline for Bradley's return. ""I cannot exactly tell how many [weeks he will miss],"" Slot said ahead of Liverpool's game against Newcastle on Wednesday. ""It's clear he went off with a muscle injury and it's going to take a while before he's back."" Bradley's injury raises doubts that he will regain fitness in time for Northern Ireland's friendlies against Switzerland and Sweden on 21 and 25 March. Bradley has won 23 caps for Northern Ireland and captained the team for the first time in October."
3/17/2025,09:44,"Slot on Bradley's injury, talk of Salah winning Ballon d'Or and Newcastle","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Wednesday's Premier League game againstNewcastle(kick-off 20:15 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Slot confirmed Conor Bradley ""is out for a few weeks"" and is unable to give a time frame for his return. Alexis Mac Allister is expected ""to be OK"" but will be assessed after today's training session. He said he ""doesn't even need to enforce the message"" of not losing focus to his side because ""they know how tough the competition is."" On the possibility of rotation to keep his squad fresh after this busy fixture period: ""I'm not so sure. It is difficult because these players are trained for this and they are ready for this. They are in a certain rhythm and they have shown this season many times that they are able to do it."" Following Jamie Carragher's comments about Mohamed Salah being less likely to win the Ballon d'Or because he is an Egypt international, Slot said: ""It's mostly about the tekkers, isn't it? It's a good thing that Mo is in the discussion because it means he is doing well and we are doing well. But for him to stay in that discussion he should bring in the same performances as he's done for seven or eight months now."" More from Slot on Salah: ""Mo has had some outstanding seasons here at Liverpool and we hope he can continue this for a longer period of time but first he needs to extend his contract. You guys don't ask me about that any more, so that's a positive!"" On his contract negotiations becoming harder because of the form he is in: ""You can look at that in both ways because the better he does the more expensive he may become. But if he was doing bad, we would be having second thoughts about extending his contract. I think for everyone it is the best that he brings the performances he is now."" He said saying Newcastle's Alexander Isak is in fine form ""is an understatement because he is actually in excellent form,"" and added: ""We have two very good centre-backs though, which is what you need when you face the quality of Isak."" More on opponents Newcastle: ""They score a lot of goals and they have so many offensive threats. Normally they are not a team that concedes many because they show very aggressive defending.""

The Athletic journalist Rory Smith said: ""Liverpool's risk is they don't want Salah on £400,000 a week when he's 35 because you don't know what that looks like. ""It looks from this vantage point that he will still be incredible but he might not be and Liverpool don't want to be on the hook for it and that's perfectly reasonable. ""It's surprising they can't find a deal to frontload some of the money for next year because there doesn't seem any imminent signs of decline."" Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson added: ""There's a hierarchy in the dressing room wherever you go and the pay level reflects that. If you are paying Mo Salah that then obviously Virgil van Dijk is going to want to be up there or thereabouts. ""Then, you wonder what it will do to the rest of the dressing room - you simply turn around and say 'earn it then'.

Liverpool's first league win at Etihad Stadium since 2015 has given them a significant lead over the Gunners, who faceNottingham Forest,Manchester UnitedandChelseain their next three games. When asked if it was a significant win, Mac Allister added: ""Yeah, it definitely was. When you come to these places and play teams like Manchester City, you always want to win.

3/17/2025,13:45,Szobozslai's running meets Salah's grit,"""Hand it over, hand it over, hand it over Manchester."" The travelling Liverpool fans spent the moments around full-time atManchester Citygoading followers of the champions. While they did so, Dominik Szobozslai was the focus of countless social media comments for his decision to lie face down in the turf at the final whistle at a rain-soaked Etihad Stadium. The Hungarian clocked an impressive 11.5km on the day, a mark only bettered by Phil Foden on 11.7km. Szobozslai's 20 sprints on the day was only topped by Savinho on 23. It was a day for running after all. Liverpool clocked just 33.9% of possession, their lowest in a Premier League victory on record (since 2003-04).  A look at the average positions players took up on the day points to Manchester City building in Liverpool's half, while the Reds stayed deeper, compact and efficient. Arne Slot's side played 126 passes in Manchester City's half, while their hosts completed 427 in Liverpool territory. It was an afternoon where stinging the opponent with a couple of razor-sharp attacks won the day. Szobozslai was a key cog, offering coverage of the pitch, finding the net and assisting Mohamed Salah's opener. Salah, meanwhile, added an assist of his own and - while not running as far as his team-mate - offers grit of a varied nature. The Egyptian - seen primarily as an attacking force - won seven of his 10 duels. If his fight wasn't enough, he created three chances - a Liverpool high - and, perhaps most significantly, offered the game-defining moments that continue to set him apart. Salah has now completed a goal and assist combination 11 times this season. That tally is the most by a player in any of Europe's big five leagues since Lionel Messi did likewise with 11 in 2014-15. Salah still has almost a third of a season to put daylight between himself and the sublime Argentine before the season ends. Szobozslai deserved his brief - if somewhat damp lie down. Salah meanwhile, seemingly has no interest in taking a breather."
3/17/2025,13:00,'I don't look at others',"Virgil van Dijk has admitted Sunday's win atManchester Cityhas given Liverpool fans ""the belief"" they will win the Premier League, but distanced himself from commenting on their title chances. Reds supporters chanted ""we're going to win the league"" in the closing stages of the 2-0 win as the leaders moved 11 points clear afterArsenal's defeat byWest Hamon Saturday. ""It was a big win but I think a couple of days ago there was noise about other things, and it could go the other way,"" Van Dijk said. ""It's down to us to just keep focusing on the game ahead of us. That's what we do and that's what I've told the boys as well. ""It's all about recovery now and being ready forNewcastle, which is a big test."" Liverpool host the Magpies, who they will also face in the Carabao Cup final in March, on Wednesday, while Arsenal face a tough test at third-placedNottingham Forest. ""I don't look at others, as I've mentioned many times before,"" Van Dijk added. ""We shouldn't. It's all about what you do yourself. ""We don't take our wins for granted. We go home, recover and [begin] the preparation for Newcastle. That's the only thing we have to do. Nothing else matters."""
3/17/2025,11:24,Salah heading for record books,"Mohamed Salah is heading for a record-breaking season with Liverpool. His goal on Sunday againstManchester Citywas his 30th of the campaign in all competitions, meaning he has now hit the 30 mark on five separate seasons for the club, a record he shares with Roger Hunt and Ian Rush. Salah also provided the assist for Dominik Szoboszlai to score the second goal against Manchester City, his 21st of the season. From an assist standpoint, the 32-year-old has already smashed his best season with the Reds out of the park - but he will have goals on his mind now. His first year at Anfield in 2017-18 remains his best as a goalscorer. He found the net 44 times in all competitions with 32 of those goals coming in the Premier League alone. He now needs just eight goals from the final 11 league fixtures to surpass his best season in the top flight, while 15 goals across all competitions would see him break that record of 44 goals."
3/17/2025,09:00,'Champions' performance' - fans on victory at Man City,"We asked for your thoughts afterSunday's Premier League gamebetween Manchester City and Liverpool. The result moved the Reds 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League. William: Liverpool's defence was spot on. They were consistently pushing City back and when City did break through them, Liverpool were switched on and stopped them. Then, their attacking was sublime and the goals were well deserved. It was a champions' performance. Chris: Mohamed Salah understandably gets many of the plaudits, but Dominik Szoboszlai was equally impactful and ran strongly for the whole game. This wasn't the Manchester City of recent years, but they are still worthy opponents, and thus this victory should be celebrated. Irene:A really solid performance. They all battled, even though my nerves were gone with Jeremy Doku on Trent Alexander-Arnold! Ryan: Very resilient and professional display. Was impressed with how solid we were defensively and we did well to take advantage of our chances. We all know City are always a tough opponent - don't think we've won at Etihad Stadium for yonks - so a great achievement. Arne Slot deserves immense praise for how he set the team up and managed the game. Thought Ibou Konate and Virgil van Dijk were first class with Szoboszlai very impressive as well. Superb display! Vinni: Stats are so irrelevant - this performance is maybe my favourite Liverpool display of the season. The Reds simply toyed with City, who looked mid-table at best. Only Doku earned his payslip. Arne Slot's team just gave them the ball, knowing they were inept. Meanwhile, Liverpool simply dangled the carrot of chance, but all the time aware they are (and actually might be) in a different league. The title is won. Vive Les Rouges. Seevaramen:A great performance. But we still have to be vigilant because the title race is not over. Remember season 2013-14 under Brendan Rogers when we let the championship go against a weakChelseateam? Liverpool were five points clear with five games to go. Best be on alert."

""They have lost one game all season - how are they going to lose four games now and allow Arsenal to get over the line? I just can't see it."" Two-time Premier League winner Joe Hart added: ""He is going to have to balance the squad. ""You need that excitement and enthusiasm, but you also need Virgil van Dijk, Andy Robertson and Alisson saying: 'Just relax boys. There is a lot of work to be done and a lot of wins to be had.'

Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside after the game, he said: ""It was a massive win for us, coming here is always difficult. ""We've not got a great track record here and we were keen to put that right, get the three points and extend the lead at the top. ""We managed to do that with a very good performance in the first half and a very professional performance in the second. I thought we defended so well - what a time to get the first clean sheet in what seems like a while. ""We've got three points, another tough game out the way and extended our lead at the top. It's been a good weekend for us."" As Liverpool fans inside the Etihad sang about the Reds winning the league, Robertson stressed it is important the players do not become complacent during the run-in. ""If we are allowing our fans to get carried away then we're doing something right. It's important they enjoy it. They have to get carried away, but it's important the players don't. It's important to get that balance,"" he added. ""There's still 11 games to go.

3/17/2025,07:27,'Inevitable that Salah would be the spearhead',"Liverpool are in the form and mood to wrap up a 20th English title after a commanding, ruthless performance to sink the side who have been their closest Premier League rivals for so long. It was inevitable that Mohamed Salah would spearhead the Reds in this crucial game againstManchester Cityas he racked up more incredible numbers. The first goal meant Salah has scored 30 or more goals in five separate seasons for Liverpool, a record he shares with Roger Hunt and Ian Rush. Liverpool were efficiency personified, demonstrating how they have flourished under Arne Slot this season, while his City counterpart Pep Guardiola faces a huge rebuilding job. Slot is too composed to call it, but with Liverpool holding an 11-point lead and having only lost one league game so far this season, he can surely sense the finishing line - even with 11 games left."

We work every single day to achieve this and it is three months of very hard work to maintain this. ""There is no secret. We are 11 points clear but Arsenal has one game in hand. The best attack we had didn't end in a goal. You always have to adapt to the challenge you have. A week ago we experienced how difficult Wolves at home was. There will always be difficult games, like today. ""It is easier for us to not get excited because we know what we have to put in. This result was more about defence than attack.

3/17/2025,11:00,Sutton's predictions: Man City v Liverpool,"Manchester City basically waved the white flag at the Bernabeu on Wednesday and, without Erling Haaland, lacked belief against Real Madrid from the off. Let's be frank, it was a shambolic performance from Pep Guardiola's side, with a real lack of intensity. Part of the pickle City found themselves in was down to the way Pep had set them up. I don't know how many times Abdukodir Khusanov had played at right-back before, but it cannot be many, and the combination of Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan in central midfield alongside Nico Gonzalez just didn't work. They didn't have the legs to cope with Real. It ended up being really disappointing as a contest. Real were always favourites but when City lose, you at least expect them to go down fighting. Instead, it was over after less than five minutes. They never believed they could win and how many times have you said that about a Pep team? Liverpool had a tricky time of it againstAston Villain midweek but they must think they can get at this City side too. Sutton's prediction: 1-3 Read the full predictions and have your say here"
3/17/2025,17:22,Premier League's two superstars meet again,"Mohamed Salah's goal and assist againstAston Villaon Wednesday placed him level with Erling Haaland for the most goal contributions of any player since the Norwegian came to the Premier League - teeing up Sunday's clash between their sides almost perfectly. As well as boasting more goals, Haaland is also more clinical than the Egyptian, with his 24.3% shot-conversion rate superior to Salah's 18.2%. Most would say Salah is having the better 2024-25 so far, though. He needs only six assists in the remaining 12 matches to break the Premier League's single-season assist record and only needs nine goals or assists to surpass Andy Cole and Alan Shearer to have the most goal involvements in a top-flight campaign.

I suppose every game is meant to be a challenge in the Champions League but finishing first in the league then getting PSG, while Villa scraped through and get Club Brugge… Something feels a bit off! Joss:If it's a cup competition every team goes into the hat for a random draw for every round. This is just the typical Uefa trying to make as much money as possible. We'll still walk it though! Oli:If you want to win the Champions League then you have to beat who's in front of you. If we leave this slight dip in form behind and regain decent form I think we have enough to pull through. Let's hope Ousmane Dembele doesn't have a stormer. Tristam:PSG have not been great this year and lack any real superstars who can drag the rest up. Yes, they've beaten Man City, but so did Spurs. Paul:At some point you have to play the best sides to win the Champions League and we have had to do this on six occasions. No team in Europe will relish playing Liverpool under the lights at Anfield - ask Barcelona! Stephen:It's a tough draw, but at this stage it was always going to be. If you want to be the best you need to beat the best. If Liverpool start to play like they did in the group stages, then teams will be more worried about playing us."

""I know behind the scenes there's people working with him - Spanish speakers on a daily basis to try to build his spirits up and make him believe he can be the player that Liverpool thought they were getting. ""He's definitely a boy with talent. He's erratic. It's fair to say he's never going to become the player Liverpool thought they were signing three years ago. ""What I don't like at the moment is this perception that there has to be a scapegoat, that there's something wrong - everyone's looking at faults.""

3/17/2025,15:16,What's Nunez's xG at Liverpool?,"In June 2022, Liverpool completed the signing of Uruguay striker Darwin Nunez from Portuguese side Benfica on a six-year deal for an initial £64m. The 25-year-old could become the club's record signing, with the fee rising to a potential £85m with add-ons. So far, it hasn't exactly been value for money. In his last season at Benfica, he scored 34 times in 41 appearances across all competitions. Liverpool fans have yet to see that level of consistency. Across three seasons at Anfield, Nunez has a 13-goal underperformance - scoring 39 times from an xG of 52.4. This season, he's at -3.5, meaning he should have 3.5 goals more if we take into account the quality of chances that have fallen his way. This season, he ranks 22nd for shot conversion in the Premier League on 15.4%. Chris Wood leads the way with a shot conversion rate of 39.1% while Alexander Isak, Mohamed Salah, and Everton forwards Iliman Ndiaye and Beto make up the rest of the top five. What would you do with Nunez? Tell us, external The Uruguayan striker has a record of 223 minutes per goal in the league during this campaign, ranking 24th in this particular category. In sharp contrast his team-mate Salah is second on the list, scoring a goal every 96 minutes. While his two goals against Brentford gave the Reds a crucial win, the data points to Nunez not making the difference consistently."
3/17/2025,13:38,'Actions must follow words now',"""Players miss chances - that I can accept. What was a bit harder for me to accept was his behaviour after that chance, and by behaviour I mean it got too much in his head, where he wasn't the usual Darwin that works his butt off and makes sure he helps the team."" The gauntlet was thrown down by Arne Slot in his strangely early pre-Manchester City press conference on Thursday and Darwin Nunez has already responded on Twitter with a statement that ends with the word ""resilience"" in Spanish. Resilience is exactly what Liverpool and their mercurial Uruguayan striker need to show between now and the end of the season. In isolation, an emotionally charged draw against Everton during a Goodison Park swansong, and a midweek evening draw to a well-drilled Aston Villa side aren't the worst results ever. A reaction is required to make that so, though. They have a huge chance to make another statement on Sunday against a side who are arguably one of the most mentally fragile the Premier League has to offer right now, especially after being softened up by Real Madrid. It's still Pep Guardiola's Manchester City though, and therefore it won't be a walk in the park by any stretch of the imagination. While they may be easily discouraged by any level of suffering within the game, the ""wounded animal"" element will surely kick in if they feel encouraged enough to bite back. Liverpool need to stop being so easily discouraged and any mentally fragile players need to be dragged up by the collective, rather than the collective being dragged down by poor moments from those lacking in confidence. Resilience is the right word for it, but actions must follow words now. Find more from Josh Sexton atThe Anfield Wrap, external What would you do with Nunez?

3/17/2025,12:07,'Nunez seems unable to compose himself',"Darwin Nunez is a frustrating player. If you look at Liverpool as a club and the frontline they have in terms of versatility, he is certainly different to a lot of the attacking players they have. When he came in he became a fans favourite just because of the work rate that he gives. He would run players down, run channels and he would work really hard and the fans really enjoyed that But, on the flip side, his composure in front of goal has never been good. When you are at a big club, it is what you are measured on. Yes, you can win the fans over in terms of showing how much it means to you to play, but is he good enough to be in a Liverpool team that is competing on all fronts? Probably not. It was shown against Aston Villa - that was a huge miss. When you are given an opportunity to find a goal when you are at a team like Liverpool, you are expected to finish that. What should Reds do with Nunez? Tell us, external Nunez does not have that composure. His mind is going a hundred miles an hour and he cannot slow down his thought process and that was what happened. That miss could be costly come the end of the season. How you manage that as the head coach is quite difficult because it is frustrating that they tend to be easy opportunities he misses. It seems he can score the more difficult ones when he does not have time to think, but when he has a lot of time to think, he seems to be unable to compose himself. This is why he is seeing himself on the bench a lot under Arne Slot and it cannot really be put down to confidence as we have seen him miss chances even when he was playing with confidence under Jurgen Klopp. There is still a lot of talk around the future of Mohamed Salah. But, even if he leaves, I do not think Nunez will be the backup ready to step in. If I am being honest, I cannot see him even being there past the summer. Liverpool know that they they will need a better quality replacement than Nunez. The club are in the position they are because they have such a versatile, dynamic, powerful, quality group of forwards. I am not sure Nunez has got the quality that they want. Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Nicola Pearson"
3/17/2025,11:25,"Slot on Nunez, injuries and Man City","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game against Manchester City (kick-off 16:30). Here are the key lines from his news conference: On forward Cody Gakpo returning for the Manchester City game, Slot said ""let's see"" and that it will be ""a close call"". Slot said that he would be surprised if Conor Bradley is involved against Manchester City or Newcastle. Defender Joe Gomez has had surgery on a hamstring injury and is out for ""a long time"", with Slot stating: ""He will be back, maybe, just before the end of the season."" Slot said Diogo Jota and Trent Alexander-Arnold were taking off in the 2-2 draw at Aston Villa because they are coming back from injury. On Darwin Nunez, who missed a glaring chance to put Liverpool ahead at Villa, Slot said: ""I can accept every miss, especially from a player that has scored two very important goals against Brentford. He scored for us in the home game against Villa. I would prefer him to score but the word 'chance' says it all. It's a chance, so it's not 100% certain that the ball goes in. Players miss chances, that I can accept."" Slot continued: ""What was a bit harder to accept was his behaviour after the chance. By behaviour, I mean it got too much in his head where he wasn't the usual Darwin who works his butt off and makes sure he helps the team. I think he was too disappointed after him missing that chance. It's not about the chance for me, it's more about the 20 minutes afterwards that I want to talk to him about than him missing the chance. The most important message is you can miss a chance but you can't miss out on workrate. It's part of your life as a number nine that you sometimes miss when people expect you to score."" On what he is expecting from Manchester City: ""What I always expect from City since Pep [Guardiola] is there, a great football team. I can see them coming back already, you see the result against Newcastle. What you expect is what everyone expects when you go to the Etihad to play City. Slot added: ""You have to suffer as well and work really hard to keep them away from your goal. The style of play has always been the same from when Pep was at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and now Manchester City. Even he needs quality players to get results."" On Arsenal playing before Liverpool and how it impacts the Manchester City game: ""The bigger question is from Man City. We play a strong team again, like we did [Aston] Villa. Arsenal play before us, but that doesn't make the game more difficult. We know we have 12 games to play, Arsenal has 13 games to play. If we constantly look at Arsenal and what other teams are doing then that will not help us. We know already how difficult it is to go to the Etihad, so we don't need Arsenal to get involved in that even more.""

3/17/2025,10:02,Was Nunez's 'abysmal' miss 'one of the worst this season'?,"After a potentially damaging miss after being substituted on during the second half of Wednesday's 2-2 draw withAston Villa, Liverpool fans' patience with Darwin Nunez appears to be wearing thin. Here are some of your comments: Ruhel: Nunez's missed chances probably cost Klopp's team a league title last season. His abysmal finishing will probably cost Slot's team a league title this season. Ray: Nunez is a big disappointment. His stats showed he wasn't good enough for Liverpool but Liverpool still bought him. Speed of thought is crucial when playing at this level and he hasn't got it. He tries hard but this is not enough. He will be gone at the end of the season. Sam: Nunez's miss sums him up. Surely he's going in the summer as he's not good enough. He's had plenty of time now, time to move on! Ryan: Really, really tired of Nunez now. Not just based on Villa. Yes, he 'works hard', but he's playing for Liverpool in the Premier League. That shouldn't be a brag, it's mandatory. He's a very poor finisher and has been the star of his own catalogue of missed opportunities. He needs offloading and replacing this summer. Tom: It was a disgrace for Nunez at Villa, not only did he miss two sitters but he was laughing at the end with Martinez when he should have his head in his hands. After the game, when the rest of our players are applauding our away end, Nunez walks down the tunnel. Take the money from Saudi and buy Isak in the summer. Liam: I just cannot understand the persistence and logic behind playing Darwin Nunez. That miss tonight is one of the worst I have seen all season and I have seen nothing so far that indicates he has the ability to play for a club top in the Premier League."
3/17/2025,10:02,Salah landmark,Mohamed Salah has become the first player in Premier League history to score and assist in 10 different games in one season. The Liverpool forward is the first player to do so in one of Europe's big-five leagues since Lionel Messi in 2014-15 for Barcelona (11).
3/17/2025,09:18,'Combative and resilient performance' but have Reds 'peaked too early'?,"We asked for your thoughts after Liverpool emerged with a 2-2 draw from Wednesday's Premier League game atAston Villa. Here are some of your comments: Christopher: A combative and resilient performance at a difficult venue. Villa are in the Champions League last 16 so some perspective is needed. A point at City would also represent a good return. Arsenal are not out of it, but they are under pressure too. Let's see come May. Stuart: Liverpool should have taken advantage of Villa's early sloppiness in defence. It seemed as though players game time was being strictly managed. Should have won it, could have lost it. Eight points ahead is the main thing. Andy: As a Liverpool supporter, it feels as if the momentum is shifting and I ask myself if we peaked too early. We've often just scraped the win recently, we are still battling but we are relying on one man (Salah) more and more with goals from others dwindling. Nunez is a huge concern and at some point, Liverpool need to make an outbound decision on him and accept he isn't the right fit. Julia: I am a massive Liverpool fan, but I feel they are holding on to every game now. They don't look as slick as they did at the start of the season. Unfortunately we have a few tired players. Nunez does not do it for me at all. His work rate as a player is great but his finishing at vital times is poor and you keep thinking if another player was on the end of that ball it would be a goal. Not sure how many more chances he can be given. However, I still think Liverpool will win the league. Rob: Better second half than against Wolves and should have won if Nunez had done what he is paid to do. However, still only one defeat in the league and Arsenal cannot afford any dropped points so the pressure remains on them. Ken: Villa away is never an easy game but draws are akin to silent killers in the context of a tight title race. With games against City and Newcastle imminent in this brutal run of tough fixtures, Liverpool need to win both to restore calm. Should Nunez have hit an open target today? Yes. Should Nunez have had the opportunity to hit the target ? No. Szoboszlai was in a far better position to shoot but opted to pass on the responsibility. Players need to step up in these big moments and not shy away. Oh, and can Liverpool please work on set pieces? Poor in both boxes and it's an aspect that needs to improve rapidly."
3/17/2025,08:37,Nunez 'feels quite down' after Villa miss - Slot,"This video can not be played  Darwin Nunez is ""a bit more disappointed than the rest"" of his Liverpool team-mates after missing a huge late chance in Wednesday's 2-2 draw withAston Villa, says Reds boss Arne Slot. Substitute Nunez missed a golden chance to make it 3-2 when he blazed over from five yards after Dominik Szoboszlai squared the ball to him with 20 minutes remaining. ""You can understand there is one person in the dressing room who feels quite down,"" said Slot post-match. ""Szoboszlai made it an open goal chance and then Darwin was, of course, it was not his best leg, he's right footed, of course, but it was still a big chance. ""I was hoping that he could have got another one, because a player like him probably wouldn't miss two chances in a row. ""I think we were all disappointed, but it's normal that a player that missed a chance like this is always a bit more disappointed than the rest."" Despite the missed chances, the point at Villa Park moved Liverpool eight points clear at the top of the Premier League and Slot was happy with his team's display if not the result. ""Performance-wise, not a dip at all today, in my opinion,"" he added. ""What we must not do, and we've done that a bit too often now, is that we don't get what we deserve. ""If you look at all the chances, you put them in a row from us and from them, I think it's clear which team should have won this game, and we must not make a habit out of that. ""It happened a bit too much now, and still we are eight points clear with Arsenal, who have a game in hand. ""The only reason why we could be happy with a 2-2 was that they got the last chance of the game. A point is good to take, but for the rest - I think all for everything else I'm not happy."""
3/17/2025,08:31,'It's hard to really be too disappointed',"Liverpool dropped points in the Premier League as they came from behind to draw with Aston Villa at Villa Park. Mo Stewart from the Anfield Wrap spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live after the match and said: ""It was a ridiculous game of football, I don't think either side had control of it for longer than three or four minutes at a time. ""We created enough chances to win the game. Both Villa goals came from Liverpool defensive mistakes and the control that Arne Slot seems to crave in his football seems to have been missing for a good couple of games in a row now. ""Liverpool are still eight points clear at the top of the Premier League so it's hard to really be too disappointed. ""I think you have to recognise the fact that there have been times where Liverpool have been in good positions in the Premier League title race at this stage of the season and then had these kinds of results where you think 'it's OK, we're still at the top' and then when you get to the end of the season, you look back on those results and say 'oh well, maybe those were the ones that cost us.'"" Mikel Arteta's side sit second in the league and are the closest challengers to Liverpool but Stewart added that he doesn't believe ""Arsenal are going to be perfect between now and the end of the season"".

These players are used to this and are used to playing for trophies. Today we played very well but that also has to do with the style of play of the other team. ""Every team has to play every team twice and this week is Villa away and City away but again we did not lose. We desired more and that is the only thing we can blame ourselves for a few times now we did not get what we deserved. We must not make a habit of that."""

3/17/2025,13:53,Every game for Liverpool now 'of significant value',"Liverpool's Premier League title challenge faces a critical test over the next week. After Wednesday's match atAston Villa,the Reds travel toManchester Cityon Sunday - then there is a dress rehearsal for the Carabao Cup final withNewcastlecoming to Anfield on 26 February. It is not difficult to understand why fans view this as a pivotal point in the season. It has been a bit of a bumpy ride over the past 10 days. Losing toPlymouthin the fourth round of the FA Cup was as unwelcome as it was unexpected. Even a much-changed starting line-up should have performed much better than they did and Arne Slot will learn lessons from that. In the raucous Merseyside derby that came three days later, they were just seconds away from establishing a nine-point lead at the top of the table. Sunday's home game withWolvessaw them keep a seven-point advantage intact, but their second-half performance had an uncharacteristically nervous feel to it. Slot makes the point that, at this stage of the season, lots of games end up being much closer than expected and actually winning matches becomes a lot more important than how it is achieved. When you lead from the front in the fashion that Liverpool have, you are always in the sights of your rivals as they try to close what is still a considerable gap. All teams - even the best ones - have to overcome setbacks. So far, the Reds' setbacks have been few and far between, and when you have a player like Mohamed Salah in your team, then nothing appears out of reach. He has the capacity to turn a game in an instant, with his vision and goalscoring prowess. He is, without doubt, a gold-standard talent and his record so far this season is simply staggering. There are many rivers to cross for Liverpool between now and the end of the campaign as they chase silverware on three fronts. Every game they play will be of significant value in whatever competition on any given matchday. But, when we get to this point, what really matters is that you win and not how you do that.

3/17/2025,10:42,Sutton's predictions: Aston Villa v Liverpool,"Aston Villa are capable of beating anyone on their day, but they have not won any of their past four Premier League games and they are short of fit defenders too. So they have got bigger problems than Liverpool, who are still without Cody Gakpo but otherwise only missing Joe Gomez through injury. It was interesting to hear Reds defender Andy Robertson admitting the team felt nervous towards the end of Sunday's win overWolves.I know that feeling, but hearing Robertson say that now surprised me a little bit, because there still a long way to go in the title race. Robertson has been there, done it and won it with Liverpool before, in the Premier League and Champions League, but it shows how players feel the pressure even if I still feel their seven-point lead, with 13 games to go, is a big gap forArsenalto make up. Liverpool are not going to play well all the time, and if this is their blip - a draw in the Merseyside derby thanks to a stoppage-time equaliser byEvertonand then an edgy win over Wolves - then it is not exactly a reason to panic. In the past few weeks they have also gone out of the FA Cup and lost their final Champions League group game against PSV Eindhoven too, but it was their reserves who lost toPlymouthand, in Europe, they were already through. For Arne Slot, one of the important things now is balancing when to try to rest players - and Aston Villa have been in a similar situation all season because of their Champions League campaign. Villa do not have the strength in depth Liverpool do, but they do now have Marcus Rashford, who came on and made a bit of a difference in Saturday's draw withIpswich. I think Villa will score against Liverpool but it is the other end of the pitch that concerns me with Unai Emery's side, partly because of that lack of defenders, especially centre-halves, but also because I feel teams can always score against them anyway - they have kept only three clean sheets in the league all season. With Liverpool's attacking power, I am expecting them to find a way through. Arsenal are waiting for them to slip up, and they have got another tough away game at the weekend when they go toManchester City. They will know this is a huge week in their season, but before they go to Etihad Stadium, I can see them taking three points here. The performance for Liverpool does not matter here. It is all about the result, and maintaining that gap. Sutton's prediction: 1-2 Make your own prediction here"
3/17/2025,09:23,'Liverpool still aren't showing enough signs of weakness',"Liverpool had the pressure put on them not only byArsenal'swin but also the points they dropped at the final Goodison Park derby againstEverton. It was an emotional night on Merseyside and it brought back many memories of those games I played in. In fact, the tackles, wildness and general mayhem was a direct throwback to those less controlled times, and I loved watching it for that. Liverpool now only had to take care ofWolvesand they did, after a bit of a struggle. Champions win even when not at their best and Liverpool still aren't showing enough signs of weakness to make them look likely to fold. As they say in the game, it is up to the others to keep them honest and continue to pour on any pressure they can, even if it doesn't seem to be working.

3/17/2025,16:44,What the stats say about Liverpool's forwards,"In acolumn published on this pageearlier on Tuesday, fan writer Jordan Chamberlain said it is ""becoming increasingly obvious with every match that Liverpool need a new number nine in the summer"". A ""wasteful attack"" is also something that has been mentioned by contributors when we have asked fortopics that may be going under the radar at Anfield. Mohamed Salah has clearly been in sensational goalscoring form so far this season and instrumental in the Reds' sustained stay at the top of the Premier League, but what about the supporting cast of forwards? *G = Goals, A = Assists, GI = Goal involvements In the Premier League this season, the quartet of Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota, Cody Gakpo and Darwin Nunez have been directly involved in 35 goals between them (26 scored, nine assists). By comparison, Salah alone has 37 goal contributions (23 scored, 14 assists) - a statistic helped by the fact he has missed only 36 minutes of Liverpool's first 25 league games. *G = Goals, xG = Expected goals, */- = Goals minus expected goals Of all Premier League players to have had at least 10 shots this season, Salah ranks seventh in the division on shot-conversion rate, with 23 of his 94 attempts finding the net (24.47%). Nottingham Forest'sChris Wood (39.13%) is the only Premier League player with a conversion rate above 30% this season. Newcastlestriker Alexander Isak, who was suggested in our fan writer's column as a potential summer target for the Reds, has scored with 17 of his 65 shots (26.15%) and is fifth on that list. Gakpo (19.05%) and Diaz (18.75%) are 26th and 27th respectively, with Jota (17.24%) 35th and Nunez (16%) 42nd. Interestingly, however, only Jota of the five Liverpool players mentioned is underperforming in terms of their expected goals (xG) this term. *All statistics correct on 18 February, 2025"
3/17/2025,16:43,"Slot has lifted Liverpool to new heights, Emery believes","Liverpool have improved under Arne Slot despite their success under Jurgen Klopp, according to Aston Villa boss Unai Emery. Slot's Premier League leaders are yet to lose away from home this season, while the hosts have been beaten just once at Villa Park in the top flight, losing 2-0 toArsenalin August. Liverpool come to Villa Park for the rearranged game - because of their Carabao Cup final againstNewcastlenext month - on Wednesday knowing victory will extend their lead at the top to 10 points. Klopp won their first title for 30 years in 2020 while also lifting the Champions League in 2019 - and being a runner-up twice in both - but Emery believes Slot, who replaced Klopp last summer, has raised Liverpool further. ""With Klopp they did fantastic, but with Slot they're doing even better,"" he said. ""As a coach, it is a big challenge, a challenge to how we can collectively set our gameplan against them. It's the most difficult match we are going to play for the last weeks and months. ""We have to compete because they are going to demand a lot of us, tactically and individually. ""I appreciate them and they have a very high level of performance this year - more than the past two years. They are even doing better."""
3/17/2025,16:36,Who could be Liverpool's next centre-forward?,"We asked for your views on whether Liverpool should be looking to bring in a new centre-forward, after our fan writer suggested the club should ""go big on""Newcastleforward Alexander Isak in the summer transfer window. But is he a realistic target and the right man for Liverpool? Here are some of your thoughts: Yusuf:I do think that ever since our famous three of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah up front, Liverpool haven't had a proper centre-forward. Mane and Salah used to run down the wings, while Firmino would supply the through balls and get into the box. We still have quick wingers - Salah and Cody Gakpo on both sides have been outstanding - but if we want to make it even more fluid then finding the next Firmino is key - and that man has to be Isak. James:I don't think Newcastle would entertain offers for Isak, possibly Ollie Watkins fromAston Villaor even Matheus Cunha fromWolvescould be more likely? Todor:I would reckon that Isak is out of the question. Joao Pedro fromBrightonor one of theBrentfordforwards could be more achievable? Mez:Isak first choice, Liam Delap ofIpswichsecond choice. Mohammed:Isak is a realistic signing, why not? He can score goals, assist and also play on the wing. He is scoring loads of goals for Newcastle and the only other option is Victor Osimhen.Arsenalare interested in Marcus Thuram, whose release clause is 85m euros, and we could get Isak with his Premier League experience for that same amount. Barry:The time has come for Liverpool to make another transformative signing, someone who will have the same sort of impact on the team as Virgil van Dijk or Alisson. Perhaps Newcastle would be interested in a cash plus Darwin Nunez deal. I think Nunez could thrive at St James' Park. He would be more the main man there than at Liverpool and their fans would love him."

Defender Andy Robertson admitted to feeling ""nervous"" duringthe Reds' narrow 2-1 win. At one point, Robertson gestured for fans to calm down as a nervous energy built inside Anfield. Warnock told BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club: ""In the second half, it got to about 20 minutes or 15 to go and the fans suddenly went, 'they need us here'.

3/17/2025,14:22,'I'd be completely surprised if Rashford does not show quality at Villa' - Slot,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot has said he would be ""completely surprised"" if Marcus Rashford does not impress during his loan spell at Aston Villa, as the two sides prepare to meet at Villa Park on Wednesday. Rashford has scored seven times forManchester Unitedin matches against the Reds, but only emerged on the winning side four times in 19 meetings. The 27-year-old will be hoping to start against the league leaders after impressing in the second half of Saturday's draw withIpswich. ""I know Marcus Rashford as I follow the Premier League,"" Slot said on Tuesday. ""The first time I faced him was on the USA tour and was really impressed with how fast he is and comfortable on ball. I hope he shows that at Villa - but not tomorrow. ""I'd be completely surprised if a player of that quality isn't going to show that in upcoming months. He is a very good player."" The Reds have an opportunity to go 10 points clear at the top beforeArsenalnext play, but Slot is not looking beyond the trip the Villa Park with tough matches away toManchester Cityand at home toNewcastleto follow. ""I see it as 13 games to be played and the next one is the most important one,"" the Dutchman added. ""Villa away is likeWolvesat home [the 2-1 win on Saturday] - a difficult one. They have a great home record, maybe more when they play in the evening.Last season was 3-3. They have a very good manager who always has a very good gameplan. ""We know it's going to be a challenge but we know we have a quite OK away record this season."""

Warnock sympathised with the players on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club, stating: ""The players probably feel like they don't want to throw it away because everyone will say, 'it wasn'tManchester Citychasing you down, it was Arsenal and they lost their forward three'.

Here are the key lines from his news conference: Slot confirmed Joe Gomez and Cody Gakpo will both be unavailable for Wednesday's game: ""Cody is the closest to coming back but Joe will take quite some time. He is going to be out for a number of weeks because of a hamstring injury."" More on Gomez's absence: ""It's a big blow for Joe and for us. He works really hard to come back and then the first game when he came back, after two or three minutes we saw him making a sprint - and now he is out for weeks again. He will miss a large part of the season but we expect him to be back for the end of the season. He might need surgery but that's something we still have to assess."" When asked if the experience of winning the league as Feyenoord boss will help in the title run-in, Slot said: ""It helps if you've already experienced it. Not just me, but the players. But, it's difficult to take it from there - different players, teams and leagues. Yesterday, [La Liga leaders]Barcelona were close to conceding the 1-1[in a 1-0 win over Raya Vallecano]. It's the end phase of season when results like this are quite common. It tells you that you have a team that fights to the end. These games you need to win."" He is happy to have Diogo Jota back regularly: ""He has a role like many others. He did so well before his injury and we have missed him for three or four months. We have missed the number nine who played the first seven or eight games in every game. We don't expect him to play 90, 90, 90."" On the challenge posed by Villa: ""They beatCelticat home in an evening game. When you get the fixture list, you always know Villa away is one of the tougher ones we can face. They have brought in some very good players in the January window and qualified top eight in Champions League. We know we will be facing a tough team."" On the importance of experience in his squad: ""We lean a lot on the players. It helps they are used to playing big games in their career with a lot of pressure. The more experience you have playing big games, the better it is. Some young players maybe don't have experience of big games but make the right decisions because of their quality.

3/17/2025,07:25,'Increasingly obvious Liverpool need a new striker in the summer',"It is becoming increasingly obvious with every match that Liverpool need a new number nine in the summer. Luis Diaz finally got a start on the left wing because of Cody Gakpo's injury and scored his first goal for 10 matches. He is not a centre-forward. He does not make enough runs in behind and is not physical enough to challenge the centre-backs aerially. Diaz is an excellent left-winger, though, and there is no reason to sell - he should just be played in his best position more often. Darwin Nunez is sadly not a long-term option. He may well have a few big moments from now until the end of the season, but if Saudi money is on the table, Liverpool would be mad not to take it. After all, he has only scored six times this season. Diogo Jota is a good player but, ultimately, not reliable as a result of his abysmal injury record. He has also only scored eight goals this term - hardly prolific. Alexander Isak is the best potential option. The Swede is coming into his prime at 25 years old and has been sensational forNewcastlethis season. Liverpool's best hope of securing him would be if the Magpies miss out on Champions League football, as Isak absolutely should be competing at the highest level. Bar Isak, there are not a lot of elite strikers at clubs who will sell, so it would be wise for the Reds to go big on him this summer. Is Isak a realistic target and the right man for Liverpool?

3/17/2025,17:19,Can Robertson inspire (and calm) Reds?,"There was a point in the second half of Liverpool's win overWolverhampton Wandererson Sunday when Andy Robertson turned to a nerve-filled Kop and called for calm. The full-back - like many - could feel the anxiety raining down from all four sides of Anfield in a second half during which Arne Slot's men looked a shadow of what has become expected. A shadow of themselves technically maybe, but not so much physically. In the first half, Liverpool covered 52.6km and in the second half 53.1km. There were 66 home sprints in the opening period and 65 after the break. The intensity of their endeavour didn't drop, though the quality of their output somewhat did. It was 10 Liverpool shots in the opening 45, zero thereafter. The Reds' xG for the second period was an ugly zero. The league leaders have lost something - though it is hard to pinpoint what. Theories they are tightening under the pressure of a title race carry some weight perhaps. The coming days will fill in some blanks. The likes of Robertson - one of a handful of starters on Sunday to have won a league title before - will be crucial ifArsenal'schase is to be managed. The full-back has faced criticism this season and debate as to whether his best years are behind him has become consistent. Links withBournemouth'sMilos Kerkez have been frequent, while Robertson's own error and subsequent red card in the 2-2 draw withFulhamdid the 30-year-old no favours. But for a man 'slowing down' his contribution physically - at least on Sunday - was clear. Robertson performed 26 sprints and 308 intensive runs - both figures being the most on the pitch. He reached a top speed of 33.2km/h, according to Opta - a stat which wasn't bettered by any player on the day. With the ball, his tally of 75 touches was only bettered by Virgil van Dijk and the impressive Matheus Cunha. There is undoubtedly room for improvement, with Robertson losing possession 18 times - four behind Mohamed Salah's top mark. His duel success of two wins from eight contested also leaves space for an uptick. There is work to do, but Robertson's endeavour signals he is a player keen and still capable of doing it. There may never be a better time to settle nerves and never a more apt time for a player under the microscope to show he has plenty left in the tank."
3/17/2025,14:35,Slot still due to be on touchline to face Villa and Man City,"Arne Slot faces a touchline ban after being charged by the Football Association Liverpool boss Arne Slot will continue to be on the touchline until the outcome of his FA charge. The Reds manager has until Wednesday to respond after being charged over his behaviour towards referee Michael Oliver after the 2-2 draw atEverton- with assistant Sipke Hulshoff facing a similar charge. Liverpool go toAston Villaon Wednesday meaning Slot is due to be in the dugout at Villa Park. It is also likely he will be on the touchline for the Premier League leaders' trip toManchester Cityon Sunday - unless the process is fast-tracked. The charge is being treated as ""non standard"", which means Slot does not have the opportunity to accept a set sanction without a hearing. There has to be a hearing, which will either determine the punishment or at which Slot to deny the charge. If he denies it, it is then up to a commission to decide whether to uphold the charge and what the level of punishment would be. After Slot has responded by Wednesday, the FA has three days to go back to the club and a hearing will then take place within 10 days. Non-standard is for slightly unusual or prolonged incidents when there has been similar behaviour in the past 12 months, in this instance, it could be because of the nature of the behaviour or the comments made. Slot has already served a touchline ban, in the Carabao Cup quarter final win atSouthamptonin December, after collecting three yellow cards."

The Reds had looked on course for a comfortable victory, but Wolves rallied in the second half and Matheus Cunha's goal for the visitors ensured a tense finale at Anfield. However, Liverpool were able to hang on to restore their seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League. ""We are all human beings and I totally understand anxiety or nervousness can kick in,"" said the Netherlands international centre-back. ""I said it weeks ago, we just have to buckle up and enjoy the ride. There will be a lot of twists and turns. ""If you're not ready for it - and we have been there already - it will be a difficult couple of months for you but I feel like we as a team are ready for it.

The club has said that as well as adult prices remaining the same for next season, junior tickets will remain at £9 for the 10th season in a row. A 2% rise for 2024-25 led to protests from sections of home supporters, whorefused to display flagsin The Kop during the Europa League tie against Atalanta in April 2024. In November, Liverpool fans joined counterparts fromEverton,Manchester CityandManchester Unitedin support of aFootball Supporters' Association (FSA) campaign regarding ticket price rises. The club said on its website:, external""The club held meaningful engagement discussions with its official supporters board on ticket prices and is grateful for its important and significant contribution to those discussions."" ""The latest price freeze comes despite significant increases in Anfield matchday operating costs and continued rises in the cost of football operations in general. ""Alongside meaningful engagement with the supporters board, a survey was sent out to 500,000 Liverpool supporters last October, using the club's ticketing database, asking for their views on a number of ticketing-related topics.

3/17/2025,11:21,How do Liverpool's last 13 games compare with Arsenal?,"It is a hectic few weeks for Liverpool, with the Reds having league games pretty much every three days until the end of the month. But things ease considerably in March, when the Reds play just one league game - a home fixture against bottom clubSouthampton. That's not to say it is a quiet month, however, with Liverpool having the small matter of the Carabao Cup final againstNewcastleon 16 March. On either 4 or 5 March, Liverpool will also have the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, when they will travel to one of Paris St-Germain, Benfica, Monaco or Brest. The return leg at Anfield will take place a week later. Liverpool finish the season with a home game againstCrystal Palace- by which point they would hope to have already had the title wrapped up. They have two tough away games coming up - travelling toAston Villaand thenManchester City. They also play rivals Arsenal towards the end of the season but have the advantage of hosting that encounter. The Gunners, meanwhile, face six sides in the top half of the table in their final 13 games. As the historical table below shows, only once in Premier League history has a side held a lead of this size after 25 games and not gone on to win the title."
3/17/2025,09:06,Liverpool 2-1 Wolves - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts after Sunday's Premier League game between Liverpool and Wolves. Here are some of your comments: Liverpool fans: Steve:Nerves will be the biggest challenge to win the title. Understandable result at David Moyes'Everton,but strange feeling around Anfield on Sunday... Rich:Ground out a big result after what happened midweek. We can't win playing beautiful football every week. Showed a different side of us - and a good side, in my opinion. We go again againstAston Villa. George:Good start but second-half performance was well below par. Gave the ball away far too much and didn't offer much attacking threat. Darwin Nunez really didn't get into the game at all and I much prefer Diogo Jota in that role. We lost our flow and couldn't keep possession. Will need to play better than that this week to overcome some stiff opposition. Definitely need Cody Gakpo and Curtis Jones available otherwise the bench is a little lightweight. Happy to take the points and there is something in being able to win 'dirty'. We move on - 13 games to go and we remain in control! Roger:A very unconvincing second half, although 2-0 at half-time was also a bit flattering. Trent Alexander-Arnold looked as if his mind was elsewhere and Ibrahima Konate could easily have been sent off. Both were rightly subbed. Poor attempt by Jota to 'buy' a penalty when he should have just struck it first time. A lot of silly fouls committed but Wolves were very good in the second half and on another day could have easily got something out of the game. Sometimes it is better to be lucky than good. This was one of those games. Wolves fans: Keith:A lot to take heart from. We need that level of performance every game to the end of the season because the margin to stay up or go down is miniscule. Ant:What a performance by Wolves. If they carry on playing like that they will have no problem staying in the Premier League. Every player played as if their lives depended on it. Glyn:A good all-round performance from Wolves which they should have got something from. However, I believe our weak link lay between the sticks. Jose Sa's performance is not consistent enough for the Premier League. The first Liverpool goal was a farce and could have been averted had the keeper been braver against Luis Diaz. The second goal was even worse as Diaz was running wide and would not have been unable to finish from that angle. Mike:Too passive in the first half, but there was a clear foul in the lead-up to the penalty. I thought VAR was supposed to correct these blatant errors by the referee. Simon Hooper had a very poor game giving silly yellow cards for dissent, but only for one team. A much-improved performance from Wolves in the second half and I thought we were well worth at least a point. If we can play a full game as we played the second half we will be well clear of relegation by the end of the season."

3/17/2025,17:06,Liverpool 2-1 Wolves: Reds hold on ahead of tough week,"After watching Arsenal cut their lead at the top of the Premier League to four points yesterday, Liverpool have now reinstated their seven-point gap, but it did not come easily. The Reds started the game at home to Wolves looking fresh and determined to put Wednesday's disappointing equaliser against Everton behind them and they did so in fine fashion when Luis Diaz bundled over the line in the 15th-minute. It almost seemed to be game over when Mohamed Salah converted from the spot to net for the 23rd time this season. But that was far from the case with Wolves debutant Marshall Munetsi forcing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson into an excellent one-on-one save. The alarm bells were then ringing for Liverpool, who had a goal chalked off for a offside and a second penalty rightfully overturned, as Matheus Cunha superbly curled into the bottom corner to make it 2-1 with over 20 minutes to play. Wataru Endo's cameo from the bench was vital for the Reds as they hung on in the final minutes with the Japan international winning vital interceptions and disrupting numerous Wolves attacks. With Aston Villa to come on Wednesday night, Liverpool can move 10 points clear of the Gunners before making the short trip to the Etihad Stadium to take on Manchester City."
3/17/2025,16:36,'We got worse and worse',"Liverpool boss Arne Slot, speaking to MOTD after today's win:""It was mentally difficult the second half because we thought we scored the third, then thought we got a penalty, both situations were correctly handed by the referee. ""They got better and better, we got worse and worse. We had to show a different mentality which we did and got it over the line. ""In a season like this we have played so many great games, but in a season you want to win something you have to win the difficult ones as well when you are not playing your best. We were so close on Wednesday, this time we did survive. ""If you want to achieve something it is not only about bringing the ball out from the back or Mo [Salah] scoring goals, it is also about defending."" On the title race:""If you look at the last few seasons it has mostly been a battle between two teams. As things stand now it mostly looks like between us and Arsenal. I believe they have a 15-point game unbeaten run and I think at the start of that we were seven points clear of them and we still are now. ""So, it tells you how well they are doing but also how well we are doing."""
3/17/2025,16:17,'At times we were sloppy',"Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk, has been speaking to MOTD after today's victory:""We'd love to dominate for the full 90 minutes but it is the Premier League and Wolves can punish you and create dangerous moments against you. It says a lot we kept fighting and kept going and got the three points. ""Today showed at times that when we have the ball you can exploit it as well. Cunha was a danger man for them today we had to be aware of. Unfortunately he scored but we kept them to that. ""I definitely give them credit the way they went one v one most of the times and how they found the free man between the lines. ""At times we were sloppy as well and we couldn't keep the ball as well as we can at times."""
3/17/2025,16:03,Liverpool 2-1 Wolves: Did you know?,"Liverpool have won 30 of their 40 matches across all competitions this season, more than any other team in Europe's big five leagues. Only in 2019-20 (37) and 1982-83 (39) have they reached 30 victories in a season in fewer games. Liverpool have scored two or more goals in 17 successive matches at Anfield in all competitions - their joint-longest run of scoring two or more at home since joining the Football League in 1893 (also 17 from February to November 2019). This was the first time on record (since 2003-04) that Liverpool failed to attempt a shot in the second half of a Premier League game at Anfield. In fact, it was the first time in this period that the Reds went an entire half of football without attempting a shot in a home league match."

3/17/2025,11:02,Sutton's predictions: Liverpool v Wolves,"Wolves got a big win over Villa in their last league match and I watched them beat Blackburn in the FA Cup too. I cannot see Vitor Pereira's side getting anything at Anfield, though. Liverpool have to bounce back after conceding an equaliser so late on against Everton but I do expect them to react positively here. They might not have manager Arne Slot or his assistant Sipke Hulshoff on the bench after their red cards on Wednesday, and this is a tricky spell for them with away games against Aston Villa and Manchester City coming up next week. A lot of people might be thinking this might be their blip, but I don't think what happened in the derby is going to faze Liverpool. There are 14 games left so they are not in the home straight yet, and they still have a seven-point cushion at the top. In many ways, their players might use the dropped points at Goodison Park as a motivation to see off Wolves, and I am pretty confident they will get back on track straight away. I am going for Mohammed Salah to score and Liverpool to win comfortably. Sutton's prediction: 3-0 Read the full predictions and have your say here"

Neither the Liverpool head coach, nor his assistant Sipke Hulshoff, were allowed to speak to the media after being sent off at Goodison Park, but it felt like a day off had certainly helped calm the mood, with Slot returning to his familiar, reflective manner. ""Emotions got the better of me,"" admitted the Dutchman, who went on to say if he could go back and act differently he would do. Slot refrained from divulging a great deal about his verbal interaction with referee Michael Oliver in respect for the ""ongoing process"" which will determine the extent of his punishment. However, on midfielder Curtis Jones, who was shown a second yellow card along with Abdoulaye Doucoure for their altercation at the final whistle, he said: ""There are other ways to do that for the team and fans, so I will talk with him about that."" The Reds boss always manages to get the balance right, though, and made the point that the same applies to him, adding: ""It is an emotional sport.

3/17/2025,17:04,Liverpool v Wolves: Did you know?,"Liverpool have won 15 of their past 16 Premier League meetings with Wolves, with the exception being a 3-0 loss at Molineux in February 2023. Wolves have lost all seven of their Premier League away games against sides starting the day top of the table. OnlySheffield Wednesday(9),Bournemouth(8) andWatford(8) have visited the league leaders more times in the competition without managing to avoid defeat. Cody Gakpo has scored in each of his past six Premier League starts at Anfield, scoring seven goals. Only three different Liverpool players have scored in seven or more successive home starts in the competition: Fernando Torres and Luis Suarez (both eight) and Mohamed Salah twice (seven and eight)."
3/17/2025,11:45,Where do Liverpool rank after 24 games?,"Liverpool are the eighth team in Premier League history to have 57 points after 24 games – of the previous seven, four of them went on to win the title, while three did not. A bit more 50-50 than you expected, Liverpool fans? It is not quite as precarious as it sounds... Manchester UnitedandArsenalboth had 57 points at this stage in the 2007-08 season so of course only one of those could have gone on to win the title. The Gunners had the same number of points as Arne Slot's side at this stage two years ago too, but they had a smaller lead and were being chased by a peak – and fully-functioning –Manchester Cityteam. Not a Liverpool fan? Find and follow your team here The only team to have 57 points and a bigger lead at this stage and not win the title was Kevin Keegan'sNewcastlein 1995-96. The Magpies took 12 more points than any other side from the first 24 games but famously fell away and finished runners-up to Sir Alex Ferguson's United. It is important to note that Newcastle were not 12 points ahead after playing 24 games as chasers Manchester United had already played, and won, their 25th game and were therefore nine points behind. However, the Magpies took 57 points from their first 24 games and chasers United and Liverpool took 45 points from theirs. Only one team has ever had more than 57 points at this stage of a Premier League campaign and not gone on to win the title – something Liverpool fans will well know as it was Jurgen Klopp's Reds in 2018-19. But, similar to Arsenal two years ago, they had just a five-point lead and were being hunted down by one of Pep Guardiola's greatest-ever City sides, who went on to win the title with a whopping 98 points to Liverpool's 97."
3/17/2025,09:57,"Slot on red card, Jones and players 'mentality'","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game againstWolves(kick-off 14:00 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Slot confirmed Trent Alexander-Arnold is training with the team again after playing half an hour on Wednesday, while Joe Gomez and Tyler Morton remain out. He also said Cody Gakpo is a ""doubt"" after picking up a ""knock"" againstEverton. Followinghis red card at Goodison Park, the Liverpool boss said he wants to ""respect"" the ""ongoing process"" and ""can't go into detail"" on what happened: ""What happened was that, during the extra time that was intended to be five and went to eight, a lot happens and the emotions got the better of me. If I could do differently, I would have loved to do it differently. I hope to do it differently the next time."" On how he feels about Curtis Jones' reaction at full-time, after the midfielder received a red card: ""Happy he stands up a lot for the team. There are other ways to do that for the team and fans, so I will talk with him about that. But the same for me - I should have acted differently after the game too. But, it is an emotional sport. Individuals make wrong decisions out of emotion and that is what I did."" On the result of the Merseyside derby: ""It felt immediately after the referee blew his whistle that we lost two points. But during the 98 minutes, I didn't feel constantly that we were going to win the game. It felt like an equal game and the draw would've been a fair result."" He did see plenty of positives though: ""We won a lot on Wednesday. What I mean by that is when you look at the togetherness of the fans and the players and how much we fought to get the result. We have been praised so many times this season for how well we can play, but the players showed a different side. It gives me a lot of confidence for the upcoming 14 games."" He and his staff talk about ""mentality"" with players on a ""daily basis"": ""If you want to play at a top club like this, you need to have more than quality - you need mentality as well. If players don't have this inside them, then they don't play for one of the biggest clubs in the world."" Slot praised Wolves' improvement under Vitor Pereira and spoke about forward Matheus Cunha's impact: ""If you go to the Dutch league and look at that position [of team in 17th], there is no player like that. But he has the quality to play for one of the top five teams in England. It is one of the reasons why it is more difficult to win against number 17 in England than in Holland.""

3/17/2025,15:59,'Get over it as soon as possible' - Van Dijk,"Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk wants his side to get over their Merseyside derby frustrations ""as soon as possible"" in order to focus on their title pursuits. The Reds were pegged back at the death in Wednesday's 2-2 draw with Everton, a result which leaves them seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. Head coach Arne Slot and assistant Sipke Hulshoff were shown red cards by referee Michael Oliver after the fixture. Slot, who has already served a one-match touchline ban for accumulating three yellow cards, must now await the match official's report to discover what, if any punishment, he will receive. ""I think conceding a goal in the last seconds of a game, or even after added time of a game, is very difficult,"" said Van Dijk. ""That hurt and should hurt for each one of us but it is the reality. You have two things you can do: you can dwell on it and stay angry about it or you can take it on board, start the recovery and be ready for Wolves because that will be a difficult test again and I think that's the best thing to do. ""I think it is better to just get over it as soon as possible. It is very difficult to just put it aside because it is still so fresh and you are still thinking about it a lot and what you could have done better and differently but from today we have to move on. ""We all know we could have played better but we all know this is their game of the season and we've seen it over the years. ""Overall I think we definitely could have done better but you are still playing against a team who has strength in the way they played and we have to adapt to that."""
3/17/2025,15:59,'Liverpool's rage and frustration clear',"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot prides himself on staying cool during matches - but even he could not maintain his calm in the hothouse that was Goodison Park on Wednesday night. He was sent off, along with assistant Sipke Hulshoff, as wereEverton'sAbdoulaye Doucoure and Liverpool midfield man Curtis Jones. They were all involved in chaotic scenes after James Tarkowski's equaliser, Liverpool's rage and frustration clear after the goal was given. When the dust settled, and there is an awful lot of dust to settle after an explosive night at the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, Slot and Liverpool can reflect on now being seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. Would they have settled for that at the start of the season? You bet."
3/17/2025,12:54,'Strip the emotion out of it',"The final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park having four goals, four red cards and last-kick-of-the-game drama, only felt like a fitting way to say goodbye to The Old Lady. Being honest, I'll be more than glad to see the back of the place for how it makes Everton players seem 10-feet-tall in recent derbies, and in contrast makes Liverpool's stars look a lot less than the sum of their parts. The Reds were simply not intelligent enough in their game management and I think a 2-1 win would've flattered them, and that's what I think will rankle the most with Arne Slot. Any refereeing decisions, luck or circumstance in moments are hardly likely to be the subject in the analysis rooms of their training centre in Kirkby, but I hope they're having an in-depth chat about how they can be smarter in creating their own luck and not leaving games so in the balance as to let circumstance decide the outcome. Besides Alexis Mac Allister, few of those that started on the night can say they felt they gave the best version of themselves. While I have some sympathy around the extenuating circumstances that Goodison Park and Michael Oliver provided, they'll face more adversity in the coming weeks and months, and they'll need cooler heads to prevail. They possess those characteristics and the requisite depth to take any future challenges head on, but Slot may feel there is a lot both he and his players can learn from that cauldron of emotion they left some time after the final whistle. Strip the emotion out of it, Liverpool. Play your best game, and not the occasion, and you can beat anybody in world football right now. Find more from Josh Sexton atThe Anfield Wrap, external"
3/17/2025,11:31,Who saw red in Merseyside derby?,"The last Merseyside derby at Goodison Park was never likely to bow out quietly - a 98th minute equaliser from James Tarkowski and a brawl between players after the final whistle made sure of that. The scenes at full-time led to some confusion over who had received red cards from referee Michael Oliver. So who was sent off and why? And how long will they be suspended for? AfterEverton'sAbdoulaye Doucoure went and celebrated the result in front of Liverpool fans, Reds midfielder Curtis Jones reacted by shoving his opponent before a mass brawl ensued between players from both sides. Having already been on yellow cards, both Jones and Doucoure received second yellows and therefore red cards from Oliver. That means both will miss their side's next match - Sunday'sWolvesclash for Jones and Saturday's trip toCrystal Palacefor Doucoure. The two players were not the only ones to be given their marching orders after the final whistle, with Liverpool boss Arne Slot and his assistant Sipke Hulshoff also shown red cards. Slot appeared to be sent off after exchanging words and an angry-looking handshake with referee Oliver . According to the Premier League website, the Dutchman ""was dismissed at the end of the Merseyside derby for using offensive, insulting, or abusive language"". As a result, neither Slot or his assistant could conduct post-match media duties due to rules put in place by the Premier League in 2023 which state: ""Occupants of the technical area who have been dismissed are not allowed to take a seat in the stand, return to the field of play post-match, or conduct any post-match media."" The Premier League had earlier suggested Slot would receive a two-match ban before deleting it on their website. He could still receive a touchline ban as a result of the red card, however, the Football Association needs to review referee's Michael Oliver's report. Then, they will make a decision on whether to take no further action, remind the Reds head coach of his responsibilities or charge him. The FA has three working days to make the decision meaning it still may not come before Sunday's clash with Wolves at Anfield and Slot could still be in the dugout."
3/17/2025,10:58,"'Tame, nervous and void of creativity' - the fans' verdict","We asked for your views on Liverpool conceding a last-gasp equaliser againstEvertonin the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Here are some of your comments: Geoffrey:A courageous performance from Liverpool against an intimidating atmosphere and team who tried their best to knock us out of our stride, but failed to. Mo Salah again proving himself to be a deserving man of the match. Joel:It was disappointing to concede in the last minute but, looking at the whole game, Everton played well and we didn't deserve to win. We didn't create enough chances and we let Everton dictate the game they wanted to play. I was very proud of Curtis Jones at the end too. Pathetic behaviour from Abdoulaye Doucoure. Malcolm:Tame, nervous and void of creativity. We need to improve or we risk getting caught. Marilyn:Oh why, oh why didn't we play our lovely passing to feet game from the start? It gets results and, if nothing else, it draws fouls! It was great scrap for the neutral, but it leaves a sour taste for Reds fans. Ben:That was a crucial two points dropped, in a game which could have a bearing on the title race. There is still a seven point gap but we are a team who, in previous years, have been known to throw away title challenges, so any points dropped gives belief to the chasing pack. It's true that one result shouldn't mean pushing the panic button, but this showed how much the team relies on Salah. Tim:Michael Oliver played way too much extra time and VAR went missing for the foul on Konate for Everton's equaliser. I was disappointed with the officiating in such a high pressure game. John:Take the point and move on. It wasn't a foul leading up to Everton's first goal, the final whistle should have been blown before their second goal, and there was a foul on Konate leading up to it. Everton were very lucky!"

Liverpool attempted six shots against Everton, their lowest total in a single match in the Premier League this season. Salah has 14 assists in the Premier League this season, his most ever in a single campaign in the competition, and the second-most by any Liverpool player in a Premier League campaign, behind only Steve McManaman in 1995-96 (15)."
3/17/2025,09:49,'We wanted to be nine points clear',"Defender Andy Robertson believes ""a lot of people would have taken"" the prospect of Liverpool being seven points clear at the top of the Premier League in mid-February. Arne Slot's side extended their gap at the top of the Premier League table with Wednesday's dramatic2-2 draw at Everton, but they did have the opportunity to go nine points clear with a win. Nonetheless, Robertson is seeing the positives regarding the gap at the top in what many thought would be a transitionary season for the Reds given Slot's summer appointment. Speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside after the Goodison Park draw, Robertson said: ""When you come here, you know what to expect and I think that heightened a little bit with it being the last derby here. ""We knew what we were coming into and, for the large part, we did it well. Don't get me wrong, we could have played much better football but I thought we were right up for the fight. ""When you are winning in the 96th minute, you want to see the game out but unfortunately we probably didn't get enough bodies back when they committed their centre-backs into the box. ""It is a frustration from our point of view. We also believe there was a foul in the build-up, but we have to move on from it. ""There's nothing worse than having games in hand. You always want to be on level games and see where it takes you, so we are glad that the game in hand is out of the way. ""But we wanted three points and we wanted to be nine points clear. The fact that we're seven points clear, I think a lot of people would have taken that in mid-February."" Listen to the full post-match interview on BBC Sounds"

3/17/2025,23:35,Analysis: Everton 2-2 Liverpool,"Liverpool's fans were taunting theirEvertoncounterparts with chants of ""we won the league at Goodison Park"" just moments before James Tarkowski denied them the victory they thought was theirs. It was a response to Everton fans directing ""you lost the league at Goodison Park"" after Liverpool were defeated here near the end of last season. And those supporters would have had every right to believe the title was on its way back to Anfield as Salah's late strike looked to be putting them nine points clear ofArsenal. In the end, Liverpool had to settle for a point - a fair outcome for all the controversy surrounding the equaliser. Head coach Arne Slot, who cut an agitated figure all night as Everton's fans urged their team on with deafening noise, was furious Tarkowski's goal was allowed and appeared unhappy with referee Michael Oliver throughout. Liverpool were not quite themselves, with Everton making life uncomfortable, but their disappointment will be even more acute because they looked to be closing out the win without too many alarms until those wild closing seconds. They can console themselves by still holding a very healthy seven point lead at the top of the league."

3/17/2025,15:29,"Pride, records and points - all to play for at Goodison","Goodison Park will host its 120th and final Merseyside derby on Wednesday, more than130 years after the first in 1894. There have been some classic games but in recent years, the main theme of derbies on the blue side of Stanley Park has been cancelling one another out,. In total, as the above data from Opta Analyst shows,37 of the 119 derbies at Goodison have been draws, external, including nine of the past 12 Premier League meetings. And if points were not hard enough to come by, so are goals. Across 119 meetings, there are only six goals between the two teams, with Everton having scored 141 goals and Liverpool 147. However, those goals have also dried up in recent seasons, as five of their last 10 meetings at Goodison have ended 0-0. Either way, besides playing for the usual derby pride, the bragging rights regarding the last victory at Goodison are at stake and the winner will also forever hold a 42-41 advantage over the other. That is because at 41 apiece, both teams have won the same number of games. We are set for a big night under the lights at Goodison Park."
3/17/2025,15:03,Goodison Park hasn't been a 'fruitful place' for the Reds,"Liverpool podcaster Dan Krishan is hoping Arne Slot's side can ""take the emotion out"" of their final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, as the Reds look to avoid defeat at their rivals' ground for the second season in a row. The Reds will be looking to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League table, while the Toffees will be hoping to pull themselves further away from the relegation zone. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live aboutEverton dealing their title hopes a blow with a 2-0 home win last season, Krishan said: ""The A team will be back out for this one. I think everyone will be wanting to prove a point. ""Goodison Park hasn't been the most fruitful place for us in recent years. It has been nine draws across the past 13 games and the last time we won there was in the 2021 season. ""The 2-0 win last year forEvertonwas a massive dent and it put the final nail into our title hopes. ""If we can just take the emotion out of the game, which is going to be extremely difficult considering it is the last one at Goodison Park, we have the chance to go nine points clear. ""We should absolutely do this."""
3/17/2025,14:04,'Derby defeat would be much more likely to wobble the team',"There is only the most microscopic chance, on homeopathic levels, that Liverpool will be negatively affected by the loss toPlymouth. Joyous and historic though it was for the home side, the visitors that started were not even close to the first team that is usually sent out by Arne Slot and the players know this. Officially it was the first XI but, when you look at the teamsheet, this was for all intents and purposes the reserve side mostly. It should still have been good enough to win as half of those players are regularly trusted to start, but that is not how the players who sat it out will consider it. Salah, Van Dijk, Mac Allister, Konate, Gravenberch, Robertson, Gakpo and Szoboszlai will be as troubled as they are when the stiffs lose while they beat Real Madrid. In fact, the likes of Salah and Van Dijk might just secretly think it shows them in an even better light - ""so you reckoned our replacements were ready to step in and take our places did you?"" Footballers can be selfish, indeed they must have that trait to be so ambitious. Much more concerning would be a defeat this week against local rivalsEverton. Until a month ago, this might have been considered three points in the bag, but with Davie Moyes' return the Toffees look much more potent in the league. If they lost to their great rivals there would still be a comfortable cushion but not as comfortable as it has been. WithAston VillaandManchester Cityaway andNewcastleat home in three of the next four games, a derby defeat would be much more likely to wobble the team than the stiffs' embarrassment at Plymouth.

3/17/2025,12:33,'What better way to hit back?',"It is all about the derby match later so what happened atPlymouthneeds to be forgotten quickly. You do not need any extra incentive to win these games, but Liverpool could take a significant nine-point lead at the top. That would be huge in the context of the title. Sunday was Arne Slot's first big setback, but surely there is no better way to hit back than to win atEverton? It is a fascinating prospect and, of course, this will not be the Liverpool side that lost at Home Park. Everton had their own disappointment at the weekend, but David Moyes will know the top priority for now is safety - and three recent league wins has gone a long way to securing that. Everton will certainly have a confidence about them. Liverpool are so often expected to win these games, based on league positions, but it is rarely that simple. Nine of the past 12 meetings at Goodison Park have been drawn. Thesearedifferent games, and the fact it is the final Goodison derby will only add to the occasion. The big hitters are set to return and Liverpool will need all their top players to be at their best. The good news for Slot is that his players have been at their best almost all season.

3/17/2025,10:38,'That Goodison crowd always is mental',"We asked for your favourite Merseyside derby memories before Wednesday's final Goodison Park meeting between Liverpool andEverton. Here are some of your replies: Peter: It was 6 December 1969. I was 13 years old. Nil-nil at half time. Minutes after the break, Emlyn Hughes scored from a ball from Cally [Ian Callaghan] - 0-1, it was anyone's game. Then it happened. A cross came over from Thommo [Peter Thompson] but Everton full back Sandy Brown had it covered. With a spectacular diving header he sent the ball into his own net. I was at the front and could see the round, muddy mark of the ball on the right side of his  forehead for the rest of the game. A great game, a great win for Liverpool at Goodison. But, all we were talking about for weeks, months perhaps even years after was Sandy Brown's amazing own goal. Simon: I was nine and went to the derby at the beginning of the 1966-67 season. To see Ray Wilson and Roger Hunt parading the recently won World Cup is a vision that I'll never forget. Stephen: Went to Goodison as a Reds fan in 2001 - Riise with his run and Gerrard with his first derby goal at Goodison. Won 3-1, sat in top tier of the main stand - wow that was steep. Had to climb up the steps, was a ground to behold in the 80s. Can understand leaving but that Goodison crowd always is mental. Andrew: When the all-time record goalscorer for Liverpool scored four goals at Goodison Park. Kopites still sing about that night 40 odd years on."
3/17/2025,10:30,'A game full of passion' - Barnes,"Former Liverpool winger John Barnes is anticipating a ""game full of passion"" when the Reds come to Goodison Park for the final time to faceEverton. Barnes scored four Merseyside derby goals, including in thefamous 4-4 FA Cup replay draw, externalin 1991. The Toffees have found form since the return of David Moyes - winning each of their past three Premier league games. ""It's always passionate,"" Barnes told Total Sport's Carl Woodward. ""The fans are always up for it. It's a game that will be closer probably than it would have been had it been played a few months ago. ""You can never tell what is going to happen in these games but it will be a game full of passion. ""I didn't particularly like the derbies because I thought they were too frenetic, too aggressive and too much passion - let's just keep calm. ""For Everton, it's been hard for the home players - the pressure the fans put on their team to do well sometimes works against them. I don't think that will have a bearing on this week's match as Everton have been winning and playing well. ""They won't be as nervous as they would have been had it been two months ago."" Arne Slot's side will be keen to respond after Sunday's shock FA Cup exit to ChampionshipPlymouth, but Barnes does not think this will derail their Premier League title charge. ""We're favourites and have been playing consistently well,"" he added. ""I can't see another team going on a run.

3/17/2025,09:01,Sutton's predictions: Everton v Liverpool,"This is actually quite tricky to call, a lot more so than when it was meant to be played in December. All those changes Arne Slot made in the FA Cup to rest his players means the quadruple is gone now for Liverpool and, with apologies for being pedantic, it also means they cannot win the Treble either - not the proper one, anyway. I didn't quite get why Slot did not load his bench with his star playersagainst Plymouth,although my first question would actually be: why not start some of them and get in front in the game, then look to make changes? I do understand Liverpool are fighting on all fronts, but did they disrespect the FA Cup? Everyone does that, to an extent, but that doesn't make it right. My point here is that Slot did not think about having his big players available if they were needed, which is whatManchester Citydid against Leyton Orient. I covered that game for BBC Radio 5 Live and when I saw Phil Foden and Kevin de Bruyne come on for City, I thought they meant business. They helped City get through. Everton also went out of the FA Cup, but David Moyes went strong with his line-upagainst Bournemouthand they hit the woodwork three times. I do not think that defeat means the Toffees have lost much of the momentum they had built from winning their past three league games and, of course, this is the last Merseyside derby to be played at Goodison Park, which adds an extra edge to it from their point of view. Part of me thinks Liverpool will still nick a win, but I am actually going to back Everton to get something here. It will be a close game, that's for sure.

3/17/2025,16:05,'We had never seen a derby like it',"This video can not be played  BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty has been reminiscing on the 4-4 thriller that took place between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park in the 1991 FA Cup fifth round. After a goalless first meeting at Anfield, the Merseyside rivals played out an exhilarating draw, which ended up being Kenny Dalglish's final match before resigning as manager of the Reds. Substitute Tony Cottee's equaliser six minutes from the end of extra time secured a draw for the hosts after they fought back from a goal down four times. The second replay, also at Goodison, finished 1-0 to the Toffees - the last FA Cup tie to go to multiple replays before a rule change the following season limited ties to one replay. ""It was an absolutely wild game because Liverpool led four times and Everton pulled them back four times,"" McNulty said. ""Liverpool scored some absolutely wonderful goals, some strange goals, people clearing the ball off the line and it flying back in. ""Every time you thought Liverpool had won the game there would be some calamity in their defence that bought Everton back into it. It was an incredible game of football. ""I remember walking away from that and people from our vintage were saying they had never seen anything like it. ""It was an absolutely wild night of football. I remember it like it was yesterday because we had never seen a derby like it, with goals being exchanged like that. ""Then obviously there were the events after it with Kenny resigning a couple of days later."" Listen to Goodison's Greatest Derbies on BBC Sounds"

3/17/2025,12:59,Relive five derby wins at Goodison - plus send us your memories,"Before Wednesday's final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park, we've taken a look at five Liverpool victories overEvertonat the old stadium during the Premier League era. Everton 2-3 Liverpool, 16 April 2001 One of the great derbies settled by one of the great derby goals. There had been four goals, two penalties - one missed - 12 yellow cards and a sending off when Gary McAllister stepped up to take a stoppage-time free-kick 45 yards from goal with the score locked at 2-2. The former Scotland international curled a wonderful effort into the near post to spark scenes of wild celebrations among the Liverpool fans. Everton 1-3 Liverpool, 15 September 2001 A 21-year-old Steven Gerrard provided an iconic derby-day goal and celebration when he equalised after Kevin Campbell's early opener. Gerrard shifted the ball past Gary Naysmith and crashed a stunning strike into the far top corner before sprinting away down the touchline in front of the Everton fans with his hand cupping his ear. A Michael Owen penalty and John Arne Riise's solo run and finish sealed a comfortable victory which will be remembered for Gerrard's virtuoso display. Everton 0-3 Liverpool, 30 August 2003 A first Liverpool goal for Harry Kewell and a first win of the season for under-pressure manager Gerrard Houllier were the headlines from a derby-day demolition in 2003. Kewell's arrival that summer fromLeedswas the source of much excitement, only enhanced by him capping a fine performance with a late third. Owen found the net twice to complete the scoring as a young Wayne Rooney saw several efforts saved by Jerzy Dudek. Everton 0-1 Liverpool, 19 December 2016 Sometimes the unconvincing, scrappy wins can be the sweetest. A tempestuous derby was settled deep into stoppage time with a goal that matched the game. Summer signing Sadio Mane reacted first to a loose ball after substitute Daniel Sturridge's shot had hit the post to send the away fans into raptures. Everton 1-4 Liverpool, 1 December 2021 Liverpool turned up the pressure on former Anfield boss Rafael Benitez by dismantling his Everton side with a devastating attacking display. Jordan Henderson and Diogo Jota struck either side of a Mohamed Salah double with Goodison Park becoming mutinous as Benitez - already unpopular from his history with the Reds - felt the wrath of the home crowd. And now it's over to you... We stuck to the Premier League era for the five above, but there are so many more standout games - the incredible 4-4 draw in the FA Cup in 1991 that led to the resignation of Reds boss Kenny Dalglish and the 5-0 win in 1982 when Ian Rush scored four to name just two.

James asked:Do you think Everton can spring a surprise and beat Liverpool? Wouldn't it be magical if Everton could win the last Merseyside derby at Goodison Park? Phil answered:Of course they can. Whether they will is another matter because Liverpool have been outstanding in the Premier League this season and are deservedly leaders. Everton beat Liverpool at Goodison late last season and it will be a special occasion as the last derby at the great old stadium. And Everton are now in much better shape since David Moyes' return as manager. It will be a tough assignment, but Everton have gained belief from those three successive league wins and must hope confidence is not knocked after going out of the FA Cup toBournemouth.

Here are the key lines from his news conference: Trent Alexander-Arnold did a partial training session on Monday and will be assessed on his availability after training on Tuesday. Fellow defender Joe Gomez is unavailable, with Slot confirming he has an injury to the same leg he was previously sidelined with. On whether the FA Cup defeat atPlymouth Argyleshould inspire a strong Merseyside derby performance: ""It should have an impact because if you work at a club like this you should compete for every trophy. To lose against Plymouth is unacceptable. The performance was far from Liverpool's standard."" He said it being the last derby at Goodison will be ""an extra reason why the atmosphere will be even better than the occasions before"", so his players ""have to be strong to resist it [the home noise] and stay focused"". On how his players will deal with that: ""You have to be as calm as you can. It's not the first time for these players to be playing in an atmosphere like this, but you have to stand up to these emotions. I presume our players are ready for another battle like they have been all season."" He said he wants to see ""cool heads but not cool legs"" to match Everton's intensity. On their opponents' form since David Moyes took over: ""I am aware of the fact that he has taken charge of four games and won three. That is a great accomplishment and they are in a better place than they were."" In response to whether the next block of fixtures will define their season: ""No because this period of five games in 15 days is what we have done all season. All stages of the season are crucial. You cannot slow down or a have a few games when you're not on top of the game because teams will catch you. That is why it is the most exciting league. It is the hardest league to win.""

3/17/2025,09:13,Bradley progress? Wasteful attack? Fans on what's going under the radar,"We asked for your views on what's the one thing going on at Liverpool that is being overlooked. Here are some of your comments: Mohammed:The main thing that goes unnoticed is Cody Gakpo's performances. There are some people that are saying he's playing well - but he's playing way better than that. Why isn't that emphasised enough? Every game he plays, I just know he's going to pull a big performance to help us win. Brian:Fixture congestion. It's mentioned, but never actually addressed. Isn't it more than a little ridiculous to expect clubs to turn a first XI, plus subs, out every three days for a sustained period? We need to find another way around having our top teams active in four major tournaments every year. Yusuf:One thing that has been going under the radar is the improvement in Conor Bradley. He has been giving some crucial assists in games as a starter for Liverpool. At only 21 years old, I definitely think he has potential to become a huge part of their defence. David:Why are we persevering with Federico Chiesa, Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez? They put in the effort but are too wasteful. Diogo Jota is a great player when fit and not recovering from injuries, but we desperately need to find players who can score more often. As for the players who have not extended their contracts, we have to assume by now that they are moving on - so we need to find replacements for them. We are letting players leave for nothing when we could have got some return on them. It doesn't make any sense because the amount of changes will hamper us next season. Eug D:With so much contract talk about, why is no-one talking about Caoimhin Kelleher? We should be trying to keep him, so get his contract sorted so he doesn't want to leave. Robel:The team's lack of quality depth in certain areas has been covered by the relatively successful results so far. One injury to Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah, Ryan Gravenberch or Diogo Jota, means the next cover is significantly a step down. Our season can be derailed with just two major injuries."

3/17/2025,14:56,"'If Liverpool beat Everton, it will have been the right decision'","Liverpool's performance againstPlymouthwas nothing short of abysmal. The senior players who started should have had more than enough to beat the worst team in the Championship, but they were shockingly bad. But, ultimately, it doesn't really matter. Talk of a quadruple is silly. It has never happened and probably never will. Liverpool's focus should entirely be on the Premier League, the Champions League and the Carabao Cup final. If we had beaten Plymouth and progressed, no doubt we would have eventually got harder draws and Arne Slot would have been tempted into picking his best players in FA Cup matches days before more important ones. Not a Liverpool fan? Find your team's page here The fixture list is jam-packed. Ludicrously, Liverpool play five Premier League matches before March. And this is when the title will be won or lost. Currently, his first XI is entirely fit - barring Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is touch and go for the Merseyside derby on Wednesday. This time last year, Jurgen Klopp was battling a mountain of injuries that eventually became unsustainable and led to the season collapsing. But under Slot, Liverpool are more available and have actually run less than any other side in the division. And while the squad players let themselves down at Plymouth, Virgil van Dijk, Ryan Gravenberch and Mo Salah stayed on Merseyside and got a much-needed rest.

3/17/2025,13:24,Who will win the league?,"The transfers - or lack of - are done. So now we have all our information at hand for picking our winners and losers this season. I really hung my hat out onArsenalwinning the Premier League at the beginning of the season, with Liverpool second. But now, the Reds look like they will go on to win it because of their squad depth and stability. I know Arsenal are close and pushing but I don't see Liverpool losing three games between now and the end of the season. They have great cover in the forward areas, so there is competition for places, and then there is the form of Mohamed Salah. He has been unbelievable this season. They are also solid at the back, despite having had injuries. Alisson missed a chunk of games and that did not really make a difference to them. Ibrahima Konate was also injured and Joe Gomez stepped in fine, and there have also been issues with Trent Alexander-Arnold. But despite all of that, this is a telling time for Liverpool because it was around this time last season that they won the Carabao Cup and were ahead in the Premier League - and then really fell away. Arsenal will be looking at the gap and thinking six points is not that much, but they are still inconsistent. Liverpool probably feel a lot more comfortable being chased down by Arsenal thanManchester City, who we know can go on a crazy run of games to close a gap. I still think City will do that, but the title is too far gone for them. If Liverpool can get through this patch of games then they will go on to win the league because, overall, they look much better than they did last season.

3/17/2025,09:51,Plymouth 1-0 Liverpool - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your views on Liverpool's FA Cup defeat against Plymouth. Here are some of your comments: Ian:Bitterly disappointing. They deserved to lose. That was a really poor side that Slot decided to put out. I don't understand why he did that. Klopp used to do the same. Show's a lack of respect for the opposition and to the competition. The FA Cup has been and will always be important to the fans. Winning is important for continuity. To say that I'm disappointed is an understatement. Shaun:Slot totally disrespected Plymouth with that squad. It was never good enough to beat a side that fought for everything. Too many so called first teamers were off it, notably Elliott who was woeful and Quansah is way too laid back with not enough urgency. Alex:Plymouth deserved that win! I thought our senior players were disappointingly poor and didn't lead the youngsters by example. What a shame! Robert:Well played Plymouth. But there are more important matches for Liverpool in the next few months so while I'm disappointed there are less games to play. If this was our starting 11 I'd be more worried but we gave two other young players debuts. Phil:I think Slot has made his first real mistake. You can't change 10 players and put so many kids together. I also feel it was disrespectful of the FA cup as well.  Angry and annoyed so like everyone else I assume it'll only be excused if we go on to win the league. CJ:Congrats to Plymouth for an excellent performance and result. It shows why quite a few of that team are not first team players. I thought the penalty was harsh, but you can't fault Plymouth for defending resolutely and wanting it more. When half the first team are rested, you know where Arne is looking ahead to. Onward and upwards."

""I think [the Liverpool players] are able to do better. Plymouth have a system and a way of playing where it is quite hard to create chances against.

3/17/2025,11:05,Sutton's predictions: Plymouth v Liverpool,"Plymouth got their first league win since the start of November when they beatWest Bromon Saturday, and they have brought a couple of players in under their new manager, Miron Muslic. Even so, you cannot see past Liverpool's quality getting them a win here. Arne Slot's side are going strong in Europe as well as the Premier League and I suppose the question is whether the number of games they play takes its toll eventually. So far, though, Slot has managed their schedule so well, and their squad is very strong. For example, Trent Alexander-Arnold is out at the moment, but Conor Bradley can come in at right-back - problem solved. I am speaking before they playTottenhamin the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, but even defeat there would not derail their season. They have dropped points here and there, but unlike every other team at the top of the Premier League, they have not had a dodgy period. Whatever team that Slot puts out here, my feeling is that Liverpool are pretty unstoppable. They have this relentless nature, and they will find a way of beating Plymouth.

Having celebrated the win againstTottenhamin the Carabao Cup semi-final with a glass of wine last night, the Dutchman cracked a couple of jokes and was in relaxed mood when he spoke to the media on Friday morning before his side travelPlymouthfor an FA Cup fourth-round tie on Sunday. Slot spoke about plenty of issues, including ruling injured Trent Alexander-Arnold out of the game, rotating his squad to ""use a few players that haven't played that much"", the ""outstanding"" Virgil van Dijk and an improvement in Darwin Nunez's form with the team finding ways to better use their number nine. He also brushed off the fixture congestion that reaching the EFL Cup final will cause, with the game againstAston Villabrought forward to Wednesday, 19 February. ""We want to be competing for every trophy and in every competition,"" he said. ""We must not complain about the amount of games we play. It is what it is."" Liverpool won the EFL Cup last season but were in the hunt for all four trophies at one point before their form dropped off towards the end of the campaign. Slot said he could not judge if the team were in better shape than last season but simply asserted they are currently ""in a very good place"". ""I'm not only talking about the result yesterday evening but the players are fit and are ready, not only the 11 that were on the pitch but those that came in as well,"" he added.

The 42-year-old Austrian replaced Wayne Rooney as Plymouth head coach last month and, despite sitting bottom of the Championship, he hopes the FA Cup can bring the fans some joy. ""A beautiful challenge is in front of us,"" he said in a pre-match news conference.

When asked to explain his philosophy, Slot said it is something he consciously takes into account to keep his squad fresh and happy. ""I definitely see the players as human beings,"" he added. ""We are very working very hard when we are preparing for games, but if you want them to keep going for such a long season, where they never have a week or two weeks off, then I think at certain moments they have to be at home as well. ""They have to be able to be a father or a husband. If you're only a football player for 15 to 17 years and you can only be a father or a husband for three weeks per year, then that would not be human. ""Of course, we take that [freshness and happiness] into account, but we do these things mainly because we think they benefit us for winning football matches."" Slot also explained that his players are now allowed to stay at home the night before a home match, rather than gathering in a hotel as they have done under previous managers. ""People that have more knowledge about this than me tell me that you always sleep better in your own bed than a hotel bed,"" he said. ""And sleep is a very important part of getting the best possible performance. ""It's nice for them to be at home with their families but also, in the opinion of the people that tell me these things, they are better prepared for our games."""
3/17/2025,11:44,"Slot on Alexander-Arnold injury, a possible quadruple and McConnell","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Sunday's FA Cup game againstPlymouth Argyle(kick-off 15:00 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Trent Alexander-Arnold remains unavailable this weekend and it is ""difficult to say"" whether or not he will be back for the Merseyside derby next week. He added: ""We don't want to take any risks, especially with so many games coming up afterwards. If he is fit then we will use him."" He praised the quality in his squad, after being able to rely on Conor Bradley to step in at right-back in Alexander Arnold's absence againstTottenhamon Thursday: ""For many positions, we have two very good players. I could go through the whole team telling you this. It's normal for a club of this magnitude to have more than 11 good players, and the right full-back position is definitely an example of that."" Midfielder Tyler Morton has picked up a shoulder injury and will be out for four weeks or maybe even longer. On the decision to not loan out 20-year-old James McConnell for the rest of the season, he explained: ""I see him on the training pitch competing with all our other midfielders. He always gives everything he has and Tyler Morton is out with an injury for a while, so that means he is taking that position for the upcoming weeks."" Liverpool are still fighting on all four fronts so he will ""definitely use some players that haven't played that much"" for Sunday's FA Cup tie. He believes it is a good opportunity for some players to get more minutes in their legs: ""If you never play them then it is so difficult for them to be ready, if we do get some injuries or suspensions."" The Reds ""want to be competing for every trophy"" this season, so he will not ""complain"" about the number of games they are going to have to play. He added: ""I don't see a disadvantage. We probably play Sunday-Wednesday-Sunday - andAston Villawill probably do the same. It is what it is."" When asked whether his side can push for an unprecedented quadruple this season, he replied: ""We are in a very good place. I'm not just talking about the results, but the players are fit and ready."" He is aware of ""how long the season still is"" and is expecting ""many difficult challenges"" to come their way, but the aim is to ""do everything to win every single football match"" for the rest of the campaign.

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast aboutthe Reds' 4-1 Carabao Cup semi-final victory over Tottenham, Dowie said: ""I actually think this is the best they have played over the past few weeks. I think everyone turned up and, as soon as the first goal went in, I thought it was a really comfortable performance. ""Liverpool fully deserved to go through. It is great for them, that is two finals in a row and it is always a great day out for the fans."" Dowie added that there is no reason why Arne Slot shouldn't push for the quadruple in his first season at Anfield: ""There were moments last night when I was looking around the team and seeing individuals playing with so much confidence. ""I mean, you look at the bench and he can just bring on the likes of Diogo Jota. ""Credit to the staff as well. It is very rare to get to this stage of the season and have a fully fit squad - except Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast, Atkinson said: ""Liverpool were excellent which, off the back of the first leg, was hugely vindicating. ""They look certain every single time they take to the pitch so I wasn't worried going into the game. Liverpool play better football than Tottenham and that's the way it played out through the game. ""Liverpool were genuinely excellent. They are top of the league, but they are getting better every single time they take to the pitch. ""Newcastle have the ability of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak, so you feel as though they will carry a threat going forward. ""Someone will get the better of Liverpool at some point soon, but I just struggle to see who will do it at the moment. The players are playing so well in so many areas - but the whole unit is also functioning perfectly. ""Newcastleare a good side. I've got no doubt Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimaraes will play well, but I think Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai will all play well. ""There is a lot of football for both teams to get through between now and the final, especially Liverpool. It's about six weeks away so the teams might be in a different shape or different nick."""
3/17/2025,09:43,Is Slot thinking about clean sweep of trophies?,"It is a quick turnaround for Liverpool boss Arne Slot. Fresh from his side's win overTottenhamon Thursday, the Dutchman will be speaking to the media again at about 10:15 GMT before the Reds travel to Plymouth for an FA Cup fourth-round tie on Sunday. The convincing victory over Spurs booked Liverpool's place in the Carabao Cup final on 16 March and the Anfield club still remain in the hunt for four trophies. The Reds have been in a similar position in the past but, while they ended up winning the EFL Cup last season in Jurgen Klopp's final campaign, they missed out on the others. Is Slot thinking about winning the lot? It is unlikely as he regularly says his focus is solely on his side's next game. However, will he be thinking about making changes for the game at Plymouth as he tries to manage his players? We'll hear what he has to say soon.

3/17/2025,08:52,'An absolute joy to watch' - fans react to semi-final demolition of Spurs,"We asked for your views on Thursday's 4-0 Carabao Cup semi-final second leg win overTottenham. Here are some of your comments: Marilyn: What an absolute pleasure to watch this team of ours! All playing for each other, all backing each other up. Patient, professional, lethal! Well done, Arne - what a season you are giving us Reds fans. Chris: I was a bit nervous before kick-off - but after 15 minutes it was clear there was only going to be one winner. Liverpool totally dominated Spurs in every aspect. I should think their fans are bitterly disappointed with the lack any fight. SP: There was only going to be one winner - from the first whistle Liverpool were on top of Spurs. They couldn't cope with the midfield trio and front three of Reds. It's gone slightly under the radar, but what if Liverpool win the quadruple in Slot's first season? Surely not... Steven: I don't think any team could have of handled us. Just awesome. Paul: Liverpool were an absolute joy to watch. I haven't seen them work as hard as that. They were running maniacs chasing the ball. Tottenham tried their best but were just overwhelmed by the continuous Liverpool onslaught. A well-deserved win - bring onNewcastlein the final. Geoff: There wasn't a poor performance from a Liverpool player.  Making the man of the match choice must have been the hardest of decisions. Bradley showed why we don't need to fret over Trent's contract situation, and the players we were able to bring on from the bench shows our squad strength yet again. Nothing is won yet, but the boys are giving us supporters one heck of a ride this season. Kenny: The way Liverpool played against Spurs was only just below the way they played against Barcelona in the famous 4-0 win. They were strong, the passing was sublime, the movement sublime, and every player gave 100%. That game is what I want to see every week. George: Outstanding performance - probably one of the best of the season. We hounded Spurs all over the field and didn't give an inch. The midfield were exceptional in breaking down attacks and creating and linking up with the forward line. Every Liverpool player was exceptional - not many teams could cope with that level of press and pressure. If it had been a boxing match, it would have been stopped early! A definite force to be reckoned with."
3/17/2025,08:39,'It could mark the beginning of a spectacular season',"Liverpool are flying under head coach Arne Slot and triumph in the Carabao Cup would present the Dutch manager with a first piece of silverware at Anfield. His side are also sitting six points clear at the top of the Premier League, still in the FA Cup and through to the Champions League last 16. So, while this would be seen as the least important of those four trophies, it could mark the beginning of a spectacular season for the Reds. Liverpool arrived in the second leg with work to do, having trailed after the first leg at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but they got it done without ever really getting out of third gear. Their frontline was a constant threat - with Cody Gakpo's opener coming after Dominik Szoboszlai's slotted effort was chalked off for offside and Mohamed Salah saw his rising effort tipped over the bar after sending one just wide of the post - while Caoimhin Kelleher was untested at the other end. Once Salah had dispatched his penalty to give Liverpool the lead for the first time in the tie, the home supporters were already chanting about their trip to Wembley. Liverpool now have the opportunity to make it back-to-back EFL Cups when they face a confidentNewcastleside at Wembley next month."

3/17/2025,15:47,Can Bradley replace Alexander-Arnold?,"A one-club player is rare these days, so perhaps Liverpool always knew a time might come when Trent Alexander-Arnold moved on. The 26-year-old has been with the Reds since he was a child, but his Anfield future remains uncertain amid interest from Real Madrid when his current contract runs out this summer. But the prospect of his somewhat inevitable departure has been softened by the emergence of Conor Bradley in recent years. The 21-year-old has impressed whenever he has had to deputise - from Alexander-Arnold's spell out through injury last season to an eye-catching Champions League display against Real Madrid in November. Having been with Liverpool himself since his mid-teens, it could soon be time for Bradley to make the right-back position his own. That could start with Thursday's crucial Carabao Cup semi-final second leg against Tottenham, with Alexander-Arnold out injured again. But just how do the two players compare? Defensively, there are some key areas where Bradley comes out on top. The 21-year-old wins almost twice as many duels as Alexander-Arnold per game (6.6 to 3.6) and averages more tackles (3.1 to 2.1). But England international Alexander-Arnold is rightly regarded as one of the best attacking full-backs in the world, and it is here where he excels in a statistical head-to-head with Bradley. Most noticeably, Alexander-Arnold plays more passes into the box and creates more chances on average, with 2.5 per 90 minutes compared to 1.3 for Bradley. There is no doubt the loss of Alexander-Arnold, should he depart, would be a huge blow for Liverpool. But Bradley has shown he is more than capable of stepping up and Reds fans will no doubt be confident he will do so again, should their iconic hometown hero move on."

""Everything's in a good position [in four competitions] - but only in a good position. You've still got to get over the line.

3/17/2025,10:47,Van Dijk 'irreplaceable' but is this the last year of his 'prime'?,"We asked for your thoughts on former Liverpool midfielder John Barnes' belief that Virgil van Dijk's contract should be the first priority for the club. Here are some of your comments: Mike:I agree with Barnes. Van Dijk made a huge difference when he arrived and he continues to set an example for the other defenders and young players in terms of his ability, attitude and game awareness. Salah will lose pace and strength, so I think a two-year extension would be more sensible for the club. Trent wants to try his luck in Spain and the club should have tied him down before now if they wanted to cash in. It seems unfair that Liverpool will get nothing after the years of development, but they know how it all works. Andrew:John is right! We will struggle to replace Van Dijk and Salah might not be as he is now, forever. Mohammed:They should be focusing on giving Trent a new contract. He is young and in his prime. This could be the last year of Salah and Van Dijk's prime, so instead of going for the older ones we need to go for the young one. Also, how do you know that Salah and Van Dijk are going to perform like this season, next season? Martin:I agree with Barnesy. Salah is a genius but I'm already seeing signs that he can't beat players anywhere near as often as he used to, but not for want of trying. With Alexander-Arnold, unless Slot moves him into midfield, he is always going to be my third choice because his defending is just not quite where it needs to be for a club like Liverpool. Virgil is irreplaceable - the best centre-back on the planet. Jay:I would say Van Dijk is the most important to us right now, seeing as we haven't got recognised elite cover. Salah scores a lot but, if he wasn't in the team, Gakpo, Elliott, Diaz and Nunez would step up. Trent, bon voyage lad. Bradley is a better defender by an absolute mile and Gomez is better too, so I wouldn't miss him."

Of that high-profile trio, Barnes believes it is clear who is the most critical for Liverpool to retain. ""We want them all to stay, but if you were to put them in order, I would say Virgil is the most important,"" he said. ""It would be great to have all three of them and the club have no control of that. ""I don't think we could cope with losing Van Dijk."" Barnes also suggested that the club must be careful when offering Salah a new contract despite the Egypt's forward continued outstanding form. ""He is going to slow down maybe next year or the year after,"" Barnes said. ""If you look at what he's doing now and give him a four-year contract and think he's going to be the same in three years, he won't. The club has to make the right decision. ""The club need to look at the end of that contract and think will he have the same impact as he has now.

3/17/2025,13:37,'Best boxing bouts are when there's a real contrast in styles',"The second leg of Liverpool's Carabao Cup semi-final againstTottenhamlooks to be quite an enthralling prospect. Arne Slot's team are continuing to take pretty much all before them. Ange Postecoglou's Spurs are most definitely not. So based purely on statistics, little wonder the Reds are hot favourites to once again book their place in the final. However, it would be presumptuous in the extreme to think they are almost a guarantee to reach Wembley. Slot has often spoke about his admiration for Postecoglou's footballing philosophy and favoured playing style. That is not to say he would consider similar tactics for his Liverpool team. He won't - because he doesn't need to. The Dutchman often talks about the excellence of the squad he inherited from Jurgen Klopp and the adjustments he has made in playing style are more geared towards making the most of possession and taking fewer chances when you have it. Some of the best boxing bouts are when there is a real contrast in styles, and that is similar in football. It would be wrong to suggest the Tottenham manager has made a radical change recently to the overall way his team plays. However, for sizeable part of the first leg of this tie and in Sunday's match atBrentford, there was a much more conservative approach to the game when out of possession. Spurs funnelled men back behind the ball quickly and didn't leave themselves overexposed in transition. The sample size is too small to suggest Postecoglou is now employing a more pragmatic approach, but it is interesting nevertheless that the approach paid much greater dividends in terms of end result. Conor Bradley is a more than able deputy for Trent Alexander-Arnold. His introduction as a second-half substitute for the injured vice-captain atBournemouthinjected renewed vigour and energy for Liverpool in a contest that could have gone either way. Mohamed Salah's exploits this season have of course had us reaching for new superlatives. Don't be surprised if once again it is his name dominating the headlines when the tie is over.

The Reds trail 1-0 on aggregate from the first leg. Here are the key lines from his news conference: Trent Alexander-Arnold is ruled out of Thursday's game with a ""pain in his leg"" and will be assessed before Sunday's FA Cup tie withPlymouth. Slot has not informed Alisson or Caoimhin Kelleher who will start in goal: ""I know [my decision] but the goalkeepers don't know yet. I will tell them after this."" On the Reds' quiet transfer window: ""We have a very good squad. The players have shown that the trust we have in them was correct. We don't have many injuries, not long-term injuries. There is not a reason to add to the team unless there's a chance in the market. We saw that with the goalkeeper we brought in [Giorgi Mamardashvili]."" On going into the second leg 1-0 down: ""I don't think I have to prepare them differently to any other game. From now on, until the end of the season and as long as Liverpool exists, you need to win the game. We were quite close in the first leg until the last few seconds. Nothing changes for this game compared to all the others. There's only one thing expected of you - to win the game."" On how in the first leg the referee announced a VAR decision to the stadium for the first time: ""It's not necessary but let's see if the fans like it. In the Spurs stadium, it was so obvious it wasn't needed to announce it was offside. I was more interested in why he didn't give a second yellow [for Lucas Bergvall]."" Slot expressed his frustration on the limits to the size of his squad for matchdays: ""Everywhere around the world and Europe we can take 23 players to the game. We play so many games here, so if you are able to, you need a big squad. That seems fair. I don't know why we don't have 23 for the games. It is a difficult decision to leave someone out who works every day and wants to be involved."" Four weeks have passed since the first leg in London with Spurs' defensive injury crisis beginning to ease: ""We face two different players. I wonder if Van de Ven can play [because] he has a big impact. It might change the quality of the team and we already couldn't win [the first leg], so it will be difficult. But we will be better than the last time too.""

3/17/2025,12:11,Liverpool's 'recruitment team have got it absolutely right this month',"BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty has been answering your questions on all things Premier League. Christian asked:With Liverpool entering the crunch period of the season with no signings and three contract rebels, are they gambling potential successes on no injuries/loss of form to key players? Phil answered:I wouldn't call Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold ""contract rebels"". They are trying to negotiate their next deals - or their next moves - carefully, and the way they are all performing is certainly not rebellious. I suppose there is a small element of a gamble, especially with potential injuries, but ask yourself this question: who is out there who Liverpool could realistically get, who is of the sort of quality to improve their squad at the moment? I am not sure I can think of anyone in this January window. Looking at the all-round strength of Liverpool's squad, the club's recruitment team have got it absolutely right this month. Fans often clamour for signings, but coming up with realistic available names, who would actually improve things in January - a difficult month to sign quality - is not quite so easy.

3/17/2025,12:07,'The greats are just different',"Liverpool were their usual mature selves and rode their luck to hold on to all three points from a fearlessBournemouthside on Saturday. It was so much more enjoyable than the intricate tactics fest that the first hour of theArsenalvManchester Citygame showcased. There eventually comes a time when you have to decide who you are as a football club. Do you just want to win, or would you like to win while entertaining the good folk who have paid money and turned up on a freezing cold day too cheer you on. Surely, they deserve to be warmed by some excitement on the field. I talked last week about Justin Kluivert, a very exciting player and specifically about his ability to pass the ball into the net, usually resisting the temptation to panic and blast the ball semi-aimlessly in the general direction of the goal. He seemed to forget that this week, but Mo Salah rarely - if ever - forgets to be calm. The greats are just different. I was positioned right behind Salah when he scored his beautiful second goal at Vitality Stadium and it was clear he slowed himself down just at the right moment. That is why he can decide to chip, dink, curl, use the instep, the outside of his foot or indeed a toe poke. He gives himself that time by making space then slowing down at the crucial moment. ""If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs, yours is the Earth and everything that's in it."" Kipling maybe suggests too much is possible for Mo, but the forward's qualities will certainly give you the chance of a phenomenal football career.

3/17/2025,11:18,Boro winger Doak out injured for 'a number of weeks',"Ben Doak has started 21 Championship games for Middlesbrough this season Middlesbrough boss Michael Carrick has confirmed winger Ben Doak will be out for a number of weeks because of a thigh injury. The on-loan Liverpool player missed Monday night's3-2 home defeat by Sunderlandin the Championship. ""He felt his thigh in training, and we'll have to see. It's probably a number of weeks, if anything, not days, but I don't think it'll be too long,"" Carricktold BBC Radio Tees. Middlesbrough signed Doak on a season-long loanin August,and despite speculation hecould be recalledin the January transfer window, he will remain at the Riverside for the remainder of the campaign. Boro completed the signings of Aston Villa winger Samuel Iling-Junior and former Manchester City forward Kelechi Iheanachoon deadline day,ahead of the loss to Sunderland."
3/17/2025,09:15,New deals 'would trump any glee a signing would have brought',"How can you be irritated by Liverpool's lack of transfer activity when we finished top of the Champions League table, are six points clear with a game in hand in the Premier League and still in both cups? If you are a sensible Liverpool fan, you can't. Liverpool will definitely do business in the summer, but there really is not much to moan about. A new left-back is needed, but Andy Robertson and Kostas Tsimikas in rotation is not a travesty. A new holding midfielder would be good to support Ryan Gravenberch, but the Dutchman has been the best number six in Europe this season and has played almost every minute. Another centre-back could bolster the squad, but nobody would start ahead of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate anyway. Darwin Nunez is not a long-term solution at centre-forward, but we can cash in at the end of the season and sign a new striker then instead. There is no rush when it is all working and sporting director Richard Hughes probably considers the contract renewals of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk and Mohamed Salah the priority. If we announce one of those in February, it would trump any glee a new signing would have brought. Find more from Jordan Chamberlain atEmpire of the Kop, external"
3/17/2025,23:09,Gordon joins Portsmouth on loan,"Portsmouth have signed Liverpool winger Kaide Gordon on loan for the remainder of the season.

He spent the first half of the campaign at Pompey's fellow Championship sideNorwich, scoring once in 10 appearances."
3/17/2025,19:09,Morton to Middlesbrough not expected to progress,"Middlesbrough'sapproach for Liverpool midfielder Tyler Morton is not expected to progress. The Championship side did make a bid for the 22-year-old and held talks, but they have not managed to find an agreement. A package of over £10m has been reported, although sources dispute the figure. Morton has made five appearances for Liverpool this season, including in last week's3-2 Champions League defeat at PSV. Boro, who hostSunderlandin the Championship on Monday, have already taken Ben Doak on loan from Anfield this season. The 19-year-old winger has three goals in 24 games for Michael Carrick's side, who are seventh in the table and sit outside the play-off spots on goal difference."
3/17/2025,16:11,Danns set for new deal before loan move to Sunderland,"Liverpool forward Jayden Danns looks set to joinSunderlandon loan for the rest of the season. The 19-year-old is likely to join the promotion-chasing Championship side for more first-team experience but, before doing so, he is expected to sign a new long-term deal on improved terms with Liverpool. Danns, who has been with the Reds since he was eight years old, made his first-team debut last season when they beatLuton Townin a Premier League game under Jurgen Klopp in February 2024. He helped Liverpool beatChelseain the Carabao Cup final a few days later and then scored his first goals for the club in an FA Cup win againstSouthampton. Danns made his Champions League debut in defeat at PSV Eindhoven last week. He started the group stage game with Liverpool already through to the last 16."

Walcott:""Arsenal had to win [againstManchester Cityon Sunday] and put in a statement performance. ""Liverpool are, at this moment, playing at some level. ""It's going to be closer than you think but Liverpool, at this moment, I just don't see them slipping up. That's why it was really important for Arsenal to play that level."" Murphy:""Arsenal showed in the second half of last season that they're capable of going on a great run.

Here are some of your comments: Ross:We have the best squad in Europe so we don't need to add anyone. It is time to accept Trent Alexander-Arnold will go, but if we can keep Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk, then I think most of us will be pleased. David:We are looking very good and I don't see how we don't win the title and at least one of the cups. But we need to strengthen. We are in need of cover at centre-half, definitely a new left-back and, if Alexander-Arnold leaves then we need a right-back to cover Conor Bradley. Ian:I don't think we need anyone this month, but we need a right and left full-back in the summer and a top-notch number nine to replace Darwin Nunez. Just no January panic buying please. Let Andy Carroll be your warning! Peter:Nothing is required - except to sort out the three contracts, of course! Russ:Liverpool have an outstanding forward line and midfield, but the defence is -and has been for some time - fragile. If Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold leave, then what? It is obvious we need to prepare for the future. As Alan Hansen said: ""You'll win nothing with kids."""

3/17/2025,16:32,Win at Bournemouth 'a big hurdle cleared',"Sometimes you just get a sense during the season that you are watching a special team, and I cannot be the only one who felt that wutg Liverpool's win atBournemouth. There were lots of elements of their performance that were eye-catching. Mohamed Salah's genius, Alisson's sharpness, the confidence, the control, the hunger... Of course, there were moments of concern for Liverpool in the game, but that is because they were facing a team stacked with self-belief. This is a big hurdle cleared in their pursuit of the title. It is also mightily impressive that Liverpool look indestructible when the future of three of their most important players is so uncertain. Some teams would not cope with that. Salah's majestic moment is only going to create more headlines, but I am not sure anything is going to distract them this season."
3/17/2025,15:40,'Stay humble' - Salah's message to thriving Liverpool,"Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah said Liverpool's title challenge ""feels different"" to previous seasons but they have to remain focused on the games ahead. The Reds have a nine-point lead over second placedArsenal, who hostManchester Cityon Sunday afternoon, having claimed their 17th victory of the season againstBournemouthon Saturday. Under Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool were top of the table this time last season but fell away in their final eight games to finish third. ""Yeah, I think [it feels] slightly different but last season we were also very close,"" Salah said. ""As I've said before, we need to stay humble and just take it each game at a time. ""Focus on each game. We don't have to think further. Salah, who is out of contract in the summer, has now hit scored 20 Premier League goals or more in five of his eight campaigns at Anfield. ""Scoring goals and the team winning is an incredible feeling,"" he added. ""I've said it many times before that my main target this season is to win the Premier League with the team. We are going in the right direction so hopefully we can keep going like this."""
3/17/2025,12:23,What's the minimum requirement on deadline day?,"Let's be realistic.

3/17/2025,10:42,Bournemouth 0-2 Liverpool - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between Bournemouth and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Bournemouth fans Sam:Bournemouth just fell short in the final third during this game. The Kluivert miss summed it all up really. It wasn't the electric game we were all expecting, but the boys can be proud of the performance they put in. Charles:A great game. The Cherries battled but didn't get the breaks they deserved. The penalty was soft and Salah's finish was quality. The usual intensity was there, but the depth of substitutes was not. Paul:The Cherries really gave it a proper go but were up against the very best the Premier League could offer in Liverpool. Let's all be honest here, we are not quite there yet but we will be eventually - unless we do the normal Bournemouth thing and sell our top players when the money is right. Well done to all the players, though. Siva:Bournemouth are bound for Europe, no doubt about that. They play with pace, strength and clear direction. They gave Liverpool a run and if the crossbar and posts were a couple of centimetres longer, they would have drawn this game. Well played, Bournemouth - take Europe by storm. Liverpool fans Fraser:I cannot stress how big a win this is. We were up against a good Bournemouth side, who beatArsenalandManchester Cityat home and scored nine goals in their past two games. To go there, win and keep a clean sheet is massive for us. Salah once again showing why he is critical to our team. Alisson demonstrating why he is one of the best  - if not the best - goalkeepers in the world. Our defence was rock solid. A good win for the Reds. Onwards. Carl:The Reds played well, as did Bournemouth. But, to be honest, I thought we were a tad lucky to come away with the win. Yusuf:That was a Liverpool display that proved why they are the main contenders for the league this year. They showed great maturity, particularly in the patches where Bournemouth were dominant. It was great to see the backline getting a clean sheet against tough opposition. It was a magnificent second goal from Salah! Ian:I was expecting a much tougher game, but Liverpool controlled the majority of it. Szoboszlai was poor and should have been replaced. Alexander-Arnold had another questionable performance. But, apart from that, I'm sure Arne Slot would be quite happy with how it played out. Adeniyi:How come nobody is talking about a quadruple?"

3/17/2025,18:38,Salah's numbers 'speak for themselves' - Van Dijk,"Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has been speaking to BBC Match of the Day:""A very good win, clean sheet, hard work for both sides - it was going to be tough. Bournemouth are in red-hot form, it was always going to be difficult. ""We created good moments and I think it went a bit how we expected. There are times you could maybe be better by making the right decisions with the ball, but overall we cannot complain with a 2-0 where a lot of teams have dropped points."" On goalkeeper Alisson:""There were good saves, maybe even more. We don't want our goalkeeper to work hard, but today was always going to be difficult as they have the quality to hurt you. We needed him and he deserves a nice evening off tonight."" On Mohamed Salah:""Let's make it more, let's keep going. He has obviously been amazing for the football club over all those years. I see the hard work he puts in, but the numbers speak for themselves. ""It's an outstanding performance, but he is a phenomenal player."""
3/17/2025,18:12,'We had to play at the top of our abilities',"Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to BBC Match of the Day about the win at Vitality Stadium:""That was difficult, as expected. They have made it so difficult and they have picked up a lot of points from teams which are in competition with us. We knew we had to be very intense to cope with their intensity levels. ""As expected, a difficult game. They are so intense. They keep on going and keep on running. You know you need a bit of luck to win a game like this."" On the penalty decision:""At the time, no doubt for me. All of a sudden he is tripped and I assume he got a touch. Otherwise, he continues his run and tries to score. I'm always unhappy when we concede a penalty. Sometimes you concede penalties when it's not a big chance, so I understand some frustration [from Bournemouth]. On Liverpool's Premier League form:""I think a lot about football, but I don't dream about football. It is special to win so many games away from home - the away the fans are supportive."" On watching Arsenal play Manchester City tomorrow:""Yes, I definitely will - but then the Ajax game."" Hear more from Slot on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,17:34,Bournemouth 0-2 Liverpool: Salah again highlights his importance to Reds,"Mohamed Salah is the top scorer in the Premier League with 21 goals this season Mohamed Salah again proved the difference with two goals to see off a battling Bournemouth side and take Liverpool nine points clear at the top. Earlier this week, boss Arne Slot said he wants Salah to extend his contract and has spoken to him, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold about their futures. Liverpool rejected a £150m bid from Saudi side Al Ittihad for Salah in September 2023, but with Salah's contract's expiring in the summer, fears continue to grow he could leave for nothing at the end of the season. ""Everyone wants him, including us – we want him to extend, of course. That is clear,"" said Slot on Friday. Once more the Egyptian showed just how much Liverpool need him, scoring a wonderful curled second after converting a first-half penalty to finally finish off a Bournemouth side that played their part in an entertaining match. The Cherries, who had already beaten Arsenal, Manchester City and Nottingham Forest at home this season, gave Liverpool a fright with Alisson forced into a number of vital saves, before the Reds gained the win. The joyous celebrations at the end highlighted how vital this victory was for the Reds as they move a step closer to their 20th Premier League title."
3/17/2025,17:27,Bournemouth 0-2 Liverpool: Key stats,"Liverpool extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to 19 games (W14 D5). Away from home, the Reds are unbeaten in 14 league games (W9 D5) and only between January 2019 and February 2020 (21 games) have they had a longer run without defeat on the road in the competition. Mohamed Salah has now scored 11 Premier League goals against Bournemouth, the seventh side he has scored 10 or more goals against in the competition. Only Alan Shearer (12) has netted double figures against more different opponents in Premier League history."

3/17/2025,11:20,Sutton's predictions: Bournemouth v Liverpool,"Liverpool had the luxury of resting players for their final Champions League group game, Wednesday's defeat at PSV Eindhoven, and still finish top of the table. There are some who will question whether that is in the spirit of the competition, but if you were Reds boss Arne Slot then what would you do? They are trying to win everything at the moment and they had earned the right to make those changes. His players will be well rested for this game but I just have a feeling about Bournemouth at the moment. The Cherries are depleted by injuries, and you cannot discount Mohamed Salah winning it for Liverpool the way he has done so many times before. But Andoni Iraola's side have already beatenArsenalandManchester Cityhere this season, as well asForestandNewcastle, and they have taken as many points as Liverpool - 22 - in their past 10 matches. My first thought was to go for a 2-2 draw but then I was reminded of the pledge I made last week to be braver and back Bournemouth more. That helped me to be right about them beating Forest, so I don't really have much choice but to carry on being brave, do I? Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Read the full predictions and have your say here"
3/17/2025,19:00,'One of many examples where Hughes deserves a lot of credit' - Slot,"Former Bournemouth technical director Richard Hughes ""deserves a lot of credit"" for bringing Justin Kluivert and Andoni Iraola to the Cherries, says Liverpool boss Arne Slot. Hughes moved from a playing to a recruitment capacity with Bournemouth in 2013 and remained with them until joining Liverpool as sporting director at the end of last season. He helped in their rise through the leagues, setting them up to be in a position to now be challenging for Europe as they sit seventh in the Premier League. Slot is expecting a tough challenge when he takes his league leaders to Vitality stadium on Saturday. ""They have beaten so many strong teams and have a lot of quality. ""Richard as sporting director, he hired fantastic manager as well. He [Iraola] has a clear plan and the players work incredibly hard. ""They deserve to be where they are [in the table], if not maybe a bit higher than where they are."" One player who the Reds will be wary of on Saturday is winger Justin Kluivert, who has had a breakout season with the Cherries having scored 12 goals and provided five assists in 24 games. ""He is one of many examples where Richard [Hughes] deserves a lot of credit, but also the manager too after working with him,"" said Dutchman Slot. ""The team makes individuals better. You need quality and Richard brought that here. ""It is nice for us [from Netherlands] to see Justin doing so well because he left Holland nice and early. ""He was bit criticised for that because in Holland they tend to think you need extra years before going abroad, but he has shown success going abroad early and going to new clubs. ""To be only 24 and at this level already, he will be a big talent. With him against [Ryan] Gravenberch, it will be interesting match up tomorrow."""
3/17/2025,17:04,"'Everybody wants Salah, including us'","Liverpool boss Arne Slot was asked what advice he would give to Mo Salah after  Saudi Arabia's sports minister said ""they would love to have him"" in their league.

3/17/2025,17:00,When Slot met Lineker,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot has had a long chat with Gary Lineker and you can catch it all on BBC Sounds. The pair talk about family, Virgin van Dijk, playing careers and expectations. ""Liverpool should always be competing for a league title, we should always be competing for the Champions League,"" says Slot. ""I'm hoping I will be able to keep the club at that level. ""I know people sometimes question this because they haven't seen us doing a lot in the transfer market in the summer and now in the winter as well. There's a reason for that - because we're happy with the squad. ""But I do know we're definitely working on strengthening in the summer."" Listen to the show in full here"
3/17/2025,16:33,Slot prepared for 'big one' against 'outstanding' Bournemouth,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot saying the club wanted Mohamed Salah to extend his contract was one of the main points from his news conference earlier but there was also plenty more from him. The Dutchman also mentioned that he talks to Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk about their futures as they, along with Salah, are also out of contract in the summer. Slot called his side's game at Bournemouth on Saturday the ""big one"" and it's no surprise as it could be a pivotal weekend in the Premier League title race. The Reds could extend their lead to nine points at the top-flight summit with a win on the south coast before second-placed Arsenal take on Manchester City on Sunday. However, Slot knows beating an ""outstanding"" and in-form Bournemouth will be a tough task, even if he had the luxury of resting most of his first-team regulars for the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven in midweek. Apart from analysing Andoni Iraola's side himself, Slot has also spoken to Richard Hughes about a side the Liverpool sporting director played a significant part in assembling before moving to the Anfield club last summer. On the team news front, Joe Gomez, Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez are back in training but Slot will have to decide if they are ready for the Bournemouth game."
3/17/2025,16:22,Bournemouth v Liverpool: Did you know?,"Bournemouth earned four points from their first four Premier League games against Liverpool (W1 D1 L2), but have since earned just three from their past 11 (W1 D0 L10). The Cherries also scored more than twice as many goals in the first four (seven) than they have against the Reds in the last 11 (three). However, Bournemouth (unbeaten in 11) and Liverpool (unbeaten in 18) account for two of the three longest ongoing unbeaten runs in the Premier League - Arsenal's 13 without defeat being the other. Since 29 November, no side has won more Premier League points than the Cherries (25 – W7 D4 L0)."
3/17/2025,12:03,"Slot on advice for Salah, resting players and Szoboszlai","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game againstBournemouth(kick-off 15:00 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Slot confirmed that Diogo Jota, Joe Gomez and Curtis Jones all trained on Friday but could not say if they will be ready for Saturday as the Reds have to ""make the smartest decision for them and for winning the game"". On advice he would have for Mohamed Salah after comments made by Saudi Arabia sports minister about wanting the Egypt forward to play in the country: ""He has been doing so well for so many years that everyone probably wants him. He has done so well without my advice for a long time so he can probably keep doing what is best for his career without my advice. But, my advice would be different than the one you mentioned [from Saudi Arabia minister]."" Slot accepts Salah will make the choice about his future that is best for him with his contract expiring in the summer: ""Everyone wants him, including us. We want him to extend of course as well, that is clear. He is old enough and wise enough and has done enough in his career to make the right decision for himself and hopefully for us too."" The boss said that his reason for resting players against PSV on Wednesday was not with Bournemouth specifically in mind but to try and keep players ""fresh"" and help in the ""long term"". On comments made by Dominik Szoboszlai last summer about the Hungary midfielder setting ""the bar too high"" in his first season at the club: ""If he said what you said, I will speak to him today or tomorrow and tell him you can never set the bar too high because that is impossible. The bar at this club is at the highest standards and this is what you have to get to."" He added: ""We are talking about consistency. He has been very consistent this season in work rate. He is a player who should set his standards high because he can definitely reach those standards."" Slot said he has spoken about Bournemouth with sporting director Richard Hughes, who previously worked with the Cherries. However, he said that is natural because he speaks with Hughes ""almost on a daily basis"" as his relationship with him is ""very good"" and ""what you can expect when you win a lot of games"".

3/17/2025,09:29,Slot set to bring back rested first-team regulars for 'Hughes derby',"It will be the Richard Hughes derby this weekend when Premier League leaders Liverpool playBournemouthon Saturday. Hughes left his role as technical director of the Cherries to become Liverpool's sporting director last summer and will be familiar with plenty of the south coast club's players. He was heavily involved in assembling the vast majority of the Bournemouth team that thrashedNottingham Forest5-0 last week and a side who look set to provide the Reds with a tough test. Liverpool manager Arne Slot will be talking to the media at about 11:00 GMT on Friday in the build-up to the trip to face a side that has not lost in 11 games. With the Reds already guaranteed to go through to the last 16 of the Champions League before playing at PSV Eindhoven on Wednesday, Slot chose to rest nine of his first-team regulars prior to Saturday's game. Trent Alexander-Arnold, Alisson Becker, Luis Diaz, Vigil van Dijk, Ryan Gravenberch, Ibrahima Konate, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Mohamed Salah did not travel to the Netherlands and should be back. Joe Gomez, who is back in training after a hamstring issue, and the injured Curtis Jones and Diogo Jota were also left behind. We will find out what Slot makes of the challenge Bournemouth will pose and any updates on the injured players when the Dutchman speaks later on."
3/17/2025,09:24,Liverpool's ability to 'cruise' in games 'noticeably different' to Arsenal,"Even with the battling, fighting, exhausting and character-filled win atWolves, it looks increasingly difficult forArsenalto stick with Liverpool right now. That is before you consider clawing back the current six-point gap and the game in hand Arne Slot's side have againstEverton. ‌In the past 10 Premier League games, both Arsenal and Liverpool have won six and drawn four. So far so similar, but it is the higher number of games that Liverpool have been able to cruise in that is so noticeably different. Scoring 30 goals to Arsenal's 18 over the same period helps. Saturday's win overIpswichwas a classic example. You did not see Liverpool players collapsed with exhaustion on the field at the end of the game, once again they could glide off looking unruffled. ‌It is the massive difference in squad depth between the two that is just as likely to send the title north, as the better quality of players are available at Anfield.

3/17/2025,16:09,'We're happy with the squad' - Slot on quiet transfer window,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot says the season is going even better than he had expected. ""You don't think after 20 games we will have that many points and I wasn't expecting us to be top with the margin we have,"" he told Gary Lineker in an interview for Football Focus. ""It's always nice to be up there, but nobody would have expected this. I'm the last person who would have expected [reigning champions Manchester]Cityto have such a bad run."" Slot signed a three-year contract with Liverpool last summer, and is already thinking how the club can improve. ""Liverpool should always be competing for a league title - we should always be competing for the Champions League. I'm hoping I will be able to keep the club at that level,"" he said. ""I know people sometimes question this because they haven't seen us doing a lot in the transfer market in the summer and now in the winter as well. There's a reason for that - because we're happy with the squad. ""But I do know we're definitely working on strengthening in the summer."" During his playing days, Slot was a goalscoring attacking midfielder, twice winning promotion from the Dutch second division to the Eredivisie with FC Zwolle and also playing in the Uefa Cup with NAC Breda. But a route into coaching was a natural progression for Slot, who managed Dutch sides Cambuur, AZ Alkmaar and Feyenoord, where he won the league title, before moving to Liverpool. ""I don't think anyone that played with me is surprised I've become a manager,"" he added. ""It didn't take long before I thought 'I'm going to enjoy this for as long as I can and I definitely want to become a manager or a coach'."" Read the full article on Slot's rise here"
3/17/2025,08:46,PSV 3-2 Liverpool - the fans' verdict,"This video can not be played  We asked for your thoughts after Wednesday's Champions League game between PSV and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Paul:This was a game of no real consequence for us. The kids were given a run out and the first-team were rested. We are top of the leagues. Bring on Bournemouth! Faiyaz:An atrocious performance. We deserved to lose. Ian:I don't know what Arne Slot was thinking, but I feel sorry for the travelling fans who spent a lot of money to sit and watch a bunch of kids be totally outclassed and given the run-around. It won't have done much for their confidence. Adrian:I'm not sure what Slot gained from this. We want to keep the winning mentality but some of the young players will be disappointed with that result. OK he gets to rest key players, but I think this backfired a little. Vinkhu:The boys did us proud against a full first-team. We can look forward to a good team in the future. Although Bradley had a relatively poor game, most of our young stars did extremely well in the circumstances. Alan:How can we keep a player like Elliott? He is a joke, he can't tackle and he has no pace. Please get rid - that is if anyone will take him."

Aston Villa could possibly face the following four teams - Atalanta, Borussia Dortmund, Sporting Lisbon or Club Brugge."
3/17/2025,23:44,'Job done' for Slot's men,"Former Premier League defender Stephen Warnock praised Liverpool head coach Arne Slot on Match of the Day for the way he has rotated his squad in the Champions League. The fixtures keep on coming for Slot's Reds, who are still competing on four fronts, so with a place in the last 16 guaranteed, Slot rested a number of key players against PSV Eindhoven. ""Job done,"" said Warnock. ""Perfect for them to be able to rest players as that was important. ""He [Arne Slot] has taken this competition very seriously. I looked at the team last week against Lille and thought - why have you gone so strong? But it was so they were ready to rest in this game."""
3/17/2025,23:39,PSV Eindhoven 3-2 Liverpool - Chiesa shows promise despite defeat,"Arne Slot's return to the Netherlands might have ended in defeat. But Liverpool still finished top of the 36-team league phase of the Champions League and will face one of Paris St-Germain, Benfica, Monaco and Brest in the last 16 in March. Before then at least seven league and cup matches as the Premier League leaders continue to chase trophies on four fronts. The likes of Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold were all rested against PSV Eindhoven before the crucial game at Bournemouth on Saturday. Instead highly-rated youngsters Jayden Danns and James McConnell were given a chance to show what they could do, while Federico Chiesa got 90 minutes in the tank after his injury problems. Chiesa looked lively and posed a real threat as the Italy forward registered two of his side's five attempts on target. In addition, he won the penalty which allowed Cody Gakpo to score against his former club in his home city and was also heavily involved in his side's second goal. The key for Liverpool going forward is keeping Chiesa fit."
3/17/2025,23:29,'I'm proud to make my Champions League debut' - McConnell,"Liverpool midfielder James McConnell, speaking to TNT Sports:""Disappointed we didn't win the game but we topped the group thanks to the performance in the rest of the season. ""I'm proud to make my Champions League debut. I'm grateful for the opportunity. I loved playing in this atmosphere. ""The team was a bit makeshift at times with lads slotting in all over the place but we feel we should have won the game."""
3/17/2025,23:07,Did you know?,"In Conor Bradley, Harvey Elliott, James McConnell, and Jayden Danns, Liverpool started four players aged 21 or younger in a Champions League game for the first time since December 2006 against Galatasaray."
3/17/2025,22:54,'Eventful game' - Slot,"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot:""It was an eventful game and I think everyone expected that before the game."" On Amara Nallo getting sent off just four minutes into his Champions League debut:""It is cruel but he has never played first team football before and to make your debut in the Champions League is probably the hardest. ""He misinterpreted the situation and it's a big moment to learn from. It is cruel when you think 'I'm making my Champions League debut,' but you go off a few minutes later. ""A career isn't always positive, it also has negatives and he has to make sure he plays in this competition again."" On James McConnell:""If I had been surprised that would mean he had not been at this level in training, but he has been competitive. I'm not surprised but you always wonder how they will react on this stage at this level. James deserves credit for his performance today."""
3/17/2025,22:39,'Glad our place was settled' - Robertson,"Liverpool defender Andy Robertson, speaking to TNT Sports:""We can take a lot of positives from tonight and it was a chance to give the young lads a chance. ""We got our noses in front at 2-1 and then were a bit naïve, which usually doesn't happen. We tried to push when we fell behind but it just didn't happen. Results went our way elsewhere so we finish top and that's what we wanted at the start of the season."" On youngsters getting an opportunity:""They were really good. [James] McConnell was great in midfield and driving forward. Big [Jayden] Danns was great up top and held up the ball really well. ""We also had experienced players getting a chance, Federico [Chiesa] was really good and got the 90 minutes he needed."" On the new Champions League format:""Two extra games but tonight looked like carnage, the league table was all over the place, so I'm glad our place was settled. ""All the games on one night created excitement. We know whatever format it was, our aim is always to get to the last 16 and then we see if we can go further.

3/17/2025,13:50,'Common sense' to prioritise Bournemouth game,"As far Arne Slot is concerned there iss no such thing as a meaningless match and certainly not in the Champions League. In tonight's final game in the opening section of the Champions League, Liverpool could make it eight wins from eight if they can beat PSV Eindhoven. They need one point to guarantee top spot. They have already pocketed £47 million in prize money and there is another £2 million coming if they win tonight. However, given their ridiculously hectic fixture schedule, the Reds manager has decided the virtues of common sense have a superior bargaining power than even an extra couple of million pounds. By leaving nine of his regular first team squad out of the group that have made the trip to Holland, he has owned up to the fact that he has decided to disengage from that touchstone of the football manager's lexicon of 'one game at a time'. He has also admitted that, as well as preparing for tonight's game, he is doing some of the necessary planning for Saturday's big Premier League match atBournemouth. Whatever happens in Eindhoven, it is clear that the game on the south coast is of much more significance. But that is not because Slot is attaching more importance to winning the Premier League above the Champions League. It is because he realises that even if Liverpool lose tonight - something he and his players are not accustomed to this season - it will not have any effect on who they will be draw against in the first knock-out stages of the competition. The barely fathomable logistics of the new Champions League set-up does have the advantage of much fewer ""dead rubbers"". As far as the competition as a whole is concerned we're all set for an exciting finale this evening. And yet asking more players to play more matches is the absolute opposite of what we should be doing at the elite level of the game - and almost every manager will agree with that. Given that the new-look format is one of the key factors behind the decision to scrap FA cup replays, isn't that a really sad indictment of the modern game?

3/17/2025,11:51,Liverpool's group stage in pictures,"Liverpool have already qualified for the round of 16 and will finish top of the table if they avoid defeat at PSV or if Barcelona fail to beat Atalanta at home. Here's how they did it. The Reds began this year's Champions League campaign with a3-1 win against AC Milanat the San Siro. Goals from Ibrahima Konate, Virgil van Dijk and Dominik Szoboszlai got them off to the perfect start. Liverpool then hosted Bologna andwon 2-0thanks to goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Mohamed Salah. This victory meant Arne Slot became the first Liverpool boss to win eight of their first nine games in charge of the club. Liverpool clinched a1-0 win away at Leipzig, before hosting Xabi Alonso's Bayer Leverkusen. Despite drawing 0-0 at half time, Liverpoolwon 4-0with goals from Cody Gakpo and a Luis Diaz hat-trick, to ruin Alonso's return to Anfield. After not beating Real Madrid in their previous eight Champions League encounters, Liverpool got the better of them at Anfield to make it five wins from five in the group stage. Both Mohamed Salah and Kylian Mbappe (who Conor Bradley bossed to great delight) missed penalties, but Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo fired the Reds to a2-0 victory. A Mohamed Salah penalty helped Liverpool to a1-0 win over Girona, before they secured their place in the last 16 with a2-1 home win over Ligue 1 side Lille. Salah's 50th European goal for the club and a deflected Harvey Elliott strike were enough to beat the French side, who were reduced to 10 men just before the hour mark."
3/17/2025,11:33,The own-goal decision that opened up chance for Liverpool move,"Liverpool forward Cody Gakpo has revealed how the fate of his career changed when an own goal was awarded to him. The 25-year-old, who joined the Reds from PSV following the 2022 World Cup, had heard whispers of a switch to England the previous summer but had not considered Liverpool as a potential destination. Indeed, it was the intervention of his church minister - and an unexpected twist on the pitch - that convinced him. ""Everybody who knows me, knows I am a man guided by my faith,"" Gakpo explained in an article inThe Players Tribune, external. ""So, one day, I had a meeting with the pastor from my church and he brought a friend who was a pastor somewhere else. This other pastor said, ""Can I tell you something?"" This was before any big clubs had come knocking on my door. And he said that God told him that I would go to Liverpool. I kind of laughed it off like, 'Yeah, nice - we will see about that'."" With Anfield written off, the Dutch international would probably have been pulling on a very different shirt, had a goal outcome not changed everything. ""[In the summer of 2022] I could have gone toLeeds,Southampton, or I could have stayed at PSV,"" he explained. ""So I said, 'If I score only one time, I'll go to Southampton... If I score two times, I'll go to Leeds... If I score three times, I'll stay'. ""The next day we played, and I scored twice. I was also involved in a third goal - and at first, it was called as an own goal. Then I was subbed out. So, two goals, right? I thought, 'Ah, OK, it's Leeds then'. I was at peace with my decision. ""As I was sitting on the bench, I told my friend, Jordan Teze, who now plays for Monaco, the whole story. He was like, 'If God wants you to stay, that own goal will be awarded to you.' It was like a coin toss, waiting to see what they decided. It could have gone either way! But after the game, they gave me the goal. I scored three, so my fate changed. I stayed at PSV. ""It's a funny story, but in a way, that's a really important piece of the puzzle. ""Thank God I stayed because that allowed me to play in the World Cup, which led to Liverpool."""
3/17/2025,08:29,'Hopefully we can bring it to a good end' - Gakpo,"Having a squad with fewer injuries is ""the biggest difference"" for Liverpool this season as they compete on four fronts, says forward Cody Gakpo. When they won the Carabao Cup last campaign, the Reds had the chance to send outgoing manager Jurgen Klopp off with a four-trophy haul, but ultimately finished with just the one. Once again, they are still in with the chance of an unprecedented quadruple under new boss Arne Slot, topping the Premier League and Champions League tables and still active in both domestic cups. Speaking before their final Champions League group stage game against PSV Eindhoven, Gakpo said: ""I think the biggest difference is at this point last season we had a lot of injuries. ""Mo [Salah] was away for the Africa Cup of Nations so that didn't help and he injured himself over there too. Then we had Darwin [Nunez] out, Dominik [Szoboszlai] was out, Curtis [Jones] was out and Trent [Alexander-Arnold] was out as well., [Diogo] Jota and Alisson as well. So we had some problems last year which obviously didn't help. ""This year, at this point, almost everyone is fit. As a group you get more experience and you get more togetherness. We were growing last year and growing this year as well. Hopefully we can bring it to a good end."" PSV academy graduate Gakpo could start against his former side on Wednesday, something that he feels will be ""pretty strange"". ""I think I've never been in the away dressing room, so it will be the first time and [to be] on the other side of the walkout,"" he said. ""But when the game starts, all those things will fade away and we will be focused. ""We are going for the win."""

3/17/2025,19:52,"Slot on making changes, wanting to win and praise for PSV","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Wednesday's Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven (kick-off 20:00 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Having left a number of senior members of the squad at home, Slot said the younger players ""don't need to prove themselves"" as ""we know their quality"" and ""we are playing many, many games"". He added: ""These players are ready."" More on rotating his squad for the game: ""We mainly start with 13, 14 players that share most of the playing time. For those who haven't played a lot, it is useful for them to get playing time so they are ready if we get injury problems. It definitely helps us for the long term."" Liverpool need a point to be confirmed as group winners but are already certain of finishing in the top two. Slot said: ""I can say for sure it doesn't matter if we end up one or two because we will play 14, 15, 16 or 17 and it is a draw for the team we will face. So it is not of importance to the league table, but a wise man once told me - 'I've never seen anything good come from losing a football game'. So we are not going into tomorrow trying to lose a game. We will do everything we can to win it."" Slot confirmed the players left at home will have a day off on Wednesday so they can rest but ""some staff will go home early to train with them on Thursday"". He said his is ""not scared"" to make so many changes for this game, adding that it is ""so difficult to become a champion and there are so many things that need to go well"" - and, despite good form, there are ""no guarantees in football"". Slot praised PSV counterpart Peter Bosz: ""PSV fans are really, really happy he is here. He doesn't only bring results, it is a joy to watch - always positive, always eventful. We are mainly judged on results, but I hope there comes a time that managers are also judged on playing style."" He said his focus is not on praise from the media, but on what he can ""influence"" and that he and his staff ""always want to prepare as best as possible... I just work hard."""
3/17/2025,18:31,Reds stars left out of squad for PSV,"Several key first-team players have been left behind on Merseyside as Liverpool travel to the Netherlands to face PSV Eindhoven in their final Champions League group phase game on Wednesday. Head coach Arne Slot has chosen to rest nine of the starting line-up from Saturday's 4-1 win overIpswich Town. Alisson, Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ryan Gravenberch, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah have all not travelled. Only Andy Robertson and Cody Gakpo from Saturday's side were on the plane. Defender Joe Gomez returned to training on Tuesday but not in time to make the squad, while Curtis Jones and Diogo Jota remain out. Academy players Trey Nyoni, Jayden Danns, James McConnell, Amara Nallo, James Norris, Kieran Morrison, Isaac Mabaya and Trent Kone-Doherty are all in the travelling squad.

3/17/2025,15:55,'Backline far more assured when Konate is part of it',"Ibou Konate is starting to find his best form once more, so it is no surprise Liverpool have stopped conceding goals again. The Reds have let in just two Premier League goals in three games since his below-par return from injury againstManchester United, in which he looked slow and severely lacking fitness in the 2-2 Anfield draw. Konate improved atNottingham Forest, helped us keep a clean sheet atBrentfordand was sublime at home againstIpswich Townon Saturday. Liam Delap is renowned for his ability to bully defenders, but by the second half, he had stopped even contesting long balls, such was Konate and Virgil van Dijk's dominance. Konate also showed an ability to step into midfield and begin attacks, with his incisive pass to Dom Szoboszlai assisting our opener in the 4-1 win. His partnership with Van Dijk is the foundation to which this superb Liverpool side can win a title. Liverpool conceded multiple goals toNewcastle,Manchester United,TottenhamandFulhamduring his injury absence in December, but the backline is far more assured when he is part of it. Injuries have always held Konate back, but when fit and in rhythm, there are only a few centre-backs you would take over him in the world, and one of them is his Liverpool team-mate.

3/17/2025,11:27,Liverpool 4-1 Ipswich - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between Liverpool and Ipswich. Here are some of your comments: Liverpool fans Yusuf: A routine performance from Liverpool. Knew what they had to do and they executed it well. Great to see Dom back to his best and Salah and Gakpo keep on scoring. Defensively, we have been good in the last few games, but a clean sheet would be convenient to boost the backline. Now we can focus on securing top spot in the Champions League on Wednesday, before a difficult trip away to an in-form Bournemouth. Fraser: Great all round performance. Gakpo once again on fire and a massive improvement from last season. He's crucial to our attack and goals. Salah and Szoboszlai also really good and their goals were absolute crackers. Shame about conceding a clean sheet though but overall, job well done. We go onto the next game. Ken: Another professional job done but conceding a goal at the end felt deflating. The lack of clean sheets is so frustrating. Trent was brilliant with solid performances from the others. Despite the positives, I despair at the standard of refereeing. Enciso almost dropkicked Endo in the face but only got a yellow. Dangerous and reckless play in my book. Paul: Brilliant, just brilliant from Liverpool. Measured, controlled aggression. Pressing when right to do so and able to bring quality subs off the bench to finish the game off. Ipswich fans Matt: Nowhere near as bad as last week. Let's put these two games behind us and concentrate on finishing above Wolves. Encisco looks the business. He needs to start every game. We must beat Southampton next week! Terry: Tame at best. Liverpool showed their gulf in class. However, these games will  not be the ones that define Town's season. It is difficult to integrate new players at this time of the season. Some good play at times to keep me optimistic that we can survive. Simon: With Everton getting a result against Brighton, February could be a crucial month. If Wolves sell Cunha it may well turn into a dogfight between Ipswich and Wolves for survival given the games each team plays. I feel if Town can stay up then they will go on to improve next season. William: It was a disgrace. No effort to attack and happy to keep score down. At least have a go."
3/17/2025,08:40,Slot has Reds in 'healthier' shape,"Arne Slot had huge shoes to fill replacing Jurgen Klopp, but comparing Liverpool's stats to the same stage last season shows that he's done so seamlessly…and even slightly improved them. While their goal difference and points are slightly better, their expected goal difference is noticeably so, showing that Liverpool have been more dominant under the Dutchman. Although they've taken fewer shots than last season, their improved xG shows that they've taken much better ones, which has more than made up for it. At the back, they've limited their opponents to both fewer and worse chances That does mean that they've not been quite as efficient (or lucky?) as last season, since they're matching their xG, not overperforming it… but it's much healthier in the long run to be dominating games than being efficient in them"

3/17/2025,18:52,'Players are very fit but we have to keep them fresh' - Slot,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""We created more chances and scored more goals [than the win over Lille in midweek]. The only thing I'm not happy about is conceding from a set piece at the end. ""The players are very fit but we have to keep them fresh. ""As a manger I don't think you dream that much. You don't think about when you start at a new club about the amount of points. I think about how can I make sure these players play in a style I would love them to play. ""And they have done that from the start. Today as well, the work-rate they put in when we lost the ball to prevent them from playing the counter-attack. It's a joy to watch. ""Many fans prefer to see goals and assists, I also enjoy the work rate we put in every game."" On the title race: ""We are mainly focused on ourselves. We had to win this game because it's expected from Liverpool that we win this game. It's so pleasing to see that we had a comfortable win."" On next Saturday's game with Bournemouth: ""They have been a joy to watch - so have we. It's a very interesting match up."""
3/17/2025,17:28,Liverpool 4-1 Ipswich - Gakpo catches the eye,"When talking about Liverpool's attack this season, much of the focus has quite rightly been on Mohamed Salah, who got his 18th Premier League goal of the season against Ipswich. But quietly going about his business has been Cody Gakpo. The forward scored twice on Saturday to continue his impressive run of form in front of goal lately, having now scored five goals in his last six league games. With his latest strikes, Gakpo became the first ever Dutch player to score in six successive home starts in the Premier League, surpassing Ruud van Nistelrooy and Robin van Persie's best such streaks (both five). Liverpool are yet to suffer a dip in form this season and this big win suggests it isn't coming any time soon, especially with Gakpo coming into form just at the right time to ensure not all the attacking pressure is on Salah."

3/17/2025,18:36,Slot finding Reds' 'balance' - despite what his dad thinks,"In a more light-hearted section of Friday's news conference, Liverpool boss Arne Slot revealed how his dad was not too impressed after his side's Champions League win over Lille. ""My father is a fan as well. When I called him after the game he said it wasn't as exciting as other games of Liverpool when he watched the game against Lille,"" he said. ""Then I have to try to explain to him that these games you can easily lose if you are starting to force all kinds of difficult balls - but he's not always agreeing with me! ""Nottingham Forestis probably the best in the league if you play these stupid balls - I call them stupid balls but my father would love to see us playing them a bit more. ""The risk of them is then creating many more chances [for the opposition]. There is a difficult balance between taking a risk and conceding a lot, or having control and not creating as much.

Slot has guided the Anfield club to top of the table in both the Premier League and Champions League but revealed his father - Arend - wanted more risk and excitement in Tuesday's 2-1 win over Lille. But in speaking about his discussions with his dad, Slot revealed how he wants his players to control risk in fixtures more intelligently. ""It is difficult for fans and my father is a fan as well,"" he said. ""When I called him after the game he says, 'ah, it wasn't as exciting as other games of Liverpool' when he watched the game against Lille. ""I had to try to explain to him these games you can easily lose if you are starting to force all kinds of difficult balls but he's not always agreeing with me then. ""As a manager I was quite happy with our performance against Lille as they were well organised as a team. ""I think there was one moment in the game I can remember Curtis (Jones) tried to play, from the halfway line, a bit of a ball that had a bit of risk and we lost that ball and they counter-attacked us. ""That is the risk you have if you play against a low-block team. (Nottingham) Forest is probably the best in the league if you play these stupid balls - I call them stupid balls - which my father would love to see us playing a bit more. ""There is the risk of them creating much more chances and it is a difficult balance of taking the risk and conceding a lot or having control and not creating as much. ""Against this team (Ipswich) going 1-0 down, like we have seen against Forest, is even a bigger problem especially. ""I understand it is difficult for fans who come to the stadium to see us winning but hopefully also scoring a lot of goals in an exciting match but you need two teams for that and the better we do the less likely it is teams come to Anfield and say, 'OK, let's go to a high press and press them all over the pitch'."""

3/17/2025,13:26,How can Konate improve?,"This video can not be played  Liverpool boss Arne Slot was full of praise for centre-back Ibrahima Konate before his side faceIpswich Townon Saturday. The France international has been playing with an injury to his knee but said before the Reds' Champions League match in midweek against Lille: ""I can die for this team, it's fine. My knee will come back 100% really soon, it's fine. When I saw Joe [Gomez] with his injury, I had to come back quicker and not really think about my knee."" Konate has made 22 appearances for Liverpool this season, with 15 coming in the Premier League. Slot was asked how good Konate could become and said: ""He's already very good. He's a centre-back who, without even touching the ball, is impressive because he is so strong and tall. ""One of the things he could improve is his play with the ball, bringing the ball out from the back. I would not say he was poor in that but he could improve and go to another level. ""He works really hard to improve that and I already see this improvement. Defensively, he is of the highest standard. He's fast, he's strong, he wins duels. He can cover for his team-mates as well if needed. ""Defensively, there is not a lot he can improve. From all the ball possession we have, we would like to create even more chances than we are doing now and that starts from bringing the ball out from the back."" Konate is out of contract next year and when asked if he had been offered a new deal, he simply replied ""yeah"" and then added that it was ""another conversation"". Liverpool cannot afford to lose a centre-back of his quality in his peak years, especially given the superb partnership he has formed with Virgil van Dijk. Asked whether his partnership with Van Dijk is the best in Europe at the moment, Konate said: ""This season, yes I think so. Virgil, everybody knows his quality. For me, he is the best. Nobody is better than him in this position. I've said in interviews always, I just want to be better than him one day and that's why I work hard to reach this level one day."""
3/17/2025,09:44,"Slot on Konate, Ipswich and the left-back position","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game againstIpswich Townat Anfield (kick-off 15:00 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Midfielder Curtis Jones will not be available: ""He went off during half-time [against Lille], which is not a good sign. The rest we have to wait. Let's see if he is available for PSV orBournemouth."" Slot was asked about defender Ibrahima Konate playing with an injury: ""You've seen how we try to manage that, maybe because he has some pain in his knee. It is safe for him to play. We try to manage the risk and he now comes to a moment where he would be able to play three games a week."" On how good Konate could become, Slot said: ""He's already very good. He's a centre-back who, without even touching the ball, is impressive because he is so strong and tall. One of the things he could improve is his play with the ball, bringing the ball out from the back. I would not say he was poor in that but he could improve and go to another level. He works really hard to improve that and I already see this improvement. Defensively, he is of the highest standard. He's fast, he's strong, he wins duels. He can cover for his team-mates as well if needed. Defensively, there is not a lot he can improve. From all the ball possession we have, we would like to create even more chances than we are doing now and that starts from bringing the ball out from the back."" On Andy Robertson's position and the increased competition at left-back: ""Kostas Tsimikas has proved he can play in the left full-back position as well. We have two good options in that position and we are managing loads in that position quite a bit."" Slot was asked whether he sees a difference in his side compared with his first Premier League game which was against Ipswich: ""Not a lot. The fact was that I only worked with 13-14 players for one and a half weeks back then. We've improved compared with that game - though the second-half performance was something quite similar to the performances I see currently."" On how much Ipswich have improved since then: ""They've been a bit unlucky sometimes in the last moments of games. The second half of the season is more difficult than the first half because some teams strengthen during the winter break and most teams work with their manager for half a season and that normally means a team become better. That is definitely the situation for Ipswich, although they made it really difficult for us in the first game of the season.""

3/17/2025,09:18,Liverpool v Ipswich: Did you know?,"Ipswich have won two of their past three away league games against Liverpool, having failed to win any of their first 27 visits to Anfield beforehand (D8 L19). Their last visit ended in a 5-0 defeat on the final day of the 2001-02 season, however. Liverpool have won their past 10 Premier League home games against promoted sides by an aggregate score of 34-7 since a 1-0 loss toFulhamin March 2021."

I won the FA Cup as manager of another Premier League side. I am currently managing a club in Scotland. Answer will be revealed at 17:00 GMT
3/17/2025,08:05,Efficient or ineffective?,"This Premier League pursuit becomes a lot easier if you take your chances. BBC Sport has checked in on some data comparing goals versus expected goals this season. You can see from the bar graph some teams aren't finding the goals (yellow) to outstrip the expected goals they should score (black). Tottenham, Manchester City, Arsenal, Brentford, Newcastle, Brighton, Fulham, Nottingham Forest, Wolves and Leicester have all scored more than expected. Wolves in particular have found the net 32 times from an expected 23.56 - a significant overperformance. League leaders Liverpool are pretty much bang on in returning what they should, while Arsenal have outperformed, with 43 goals from an expected 37.78. Bournemouth - 36 goals from an expected 43 - are leaving opportunities on the table. "
3/17/2025,07:58,Liverpool keep delivering for Slot,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot asked for more late winners from his side last Friday and a day later his players delivered with two added time goals from Darwin Nunez in a 2-0 win atBrentford. Just like against the Bees, the Reds have followed the Dutchman's instructions for most of the season and are reaping the benefits. Liverpool provided Slot with another victory on Tuesday when they beat Lille in the Champions League and they remain top of the Premier League and Champions League group phase table. The Anfield outfit hostIpswich Townon Saturday (15:00 GMT) and Slot will be speaking to the media later to talk all things Liverpool. Reds captain Virgil van Dijk is set to make his 300th appearance for the club against the Tractor Boys in a season in which he has again shown his worth to Liverpool. The 33-year-old centre-back has played every minute of his side's 21 games in the top flight, as well as their seven outings in the Champions League. And, while Van Dijk - along with Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah - is out of contract in the summer, his commitment, leadership and defensive qualities have been clear to see and make him so important to Slot. We will hear what Slot has to say about his compatriot, as well as his thoughts on the title race and any team news soon."
3/17/2025,15:49,Ex-Liverpool midfielder Adam named Everton's set-piece coach,"Ex-Liverpool midfielder Charlie Adam has become part of Everton's backroom staff, taking on a role as set-piece coach. The Scot has joined forces with David Moyes, who has also appointed Alan Irvine as his assistant - a role he held during Moyes' last spell with the Toffees. On Adam, Moyes said: ""Charlie is someone I have had several chats with since rejoining the club. He will be helping with set-piece situations, an area he excelled in as a player and one I believe he can really help us with now as a coach."" The 39-year-old was most recently head coach of now League Two side Fleetwood Town, who he managed between December 2023 and December 2024. Adam is not the only player to cross the Merseyside divide for a coaching role in recent years, with former Everton defender John Heitinga now an assistant first-team coach under Arne Slot at Liverpool."
3/17/2025,13:54,'Very proud' Quansah keen to maintain temperament,"Liverpool defender Jarrell Quansah is ""very proud"" to  have made his first Champions League start for Liverpool but is determined to keep level-headed about it. It was the 21-year-old's second appearance in the competition for Liverpool after making a brief cameo in their win against Bayer Leverkusen at Anfield in November. ""[It was] a very enjoyable experience - I've worked so hard in my career and to play in the Champions League at Anfield is a dream come true,"" Quansah told BBC Radio Merseyside after the win over Lille. ""[I am] very proud. [It's important to] try and keep perspective as well - if things don't go your way, you look back at these nights and they'll always be under my belt. ""Every game is a learning process for myself. I'm not getting too down if I make a mistake or two - I know I need to learn. ""Hopefully, it's going to be a long career for myself so I just will keep level and not get too high with the highs or low with the lows - temperament is the most important thing. The defender has made 12 appearances this season for the Reds, but has not started any of their past seven Premier League games. He agreed he does not enjoy being a substitute. ""I'm not going to sit here and say it's easy,"" he said. ""It's always tough. It's about how you prepare and put yourself in the best mind frame and physical condition that you can."" it's not easy when you're not in the team you've just got to do everything for the team when you're in it.""

3/17/2025,12:23,Who has been Liverpool's unexpectedly excellent player this season?,"If there is one player who deserves perhaps more credit than he gets, it is probably Ryan Gravenberch. The Dutchman has been outstanding all season. It has been a huge bonus for Liverpool, because in the summer this was the position that everyone thought would have to be filled by a new signing - most notably Martin Zubimendi - but Gravenberch was there all along. From that first game away atIpswich, he has been the solution, and you cannot imagine anyone else playing there now. There is a calmness about his play, which sometimes goes unnoticed, but his impact has been immense. Someone else who has been improving as the season has gone on is Dominik Szoboszlai. He struggled at times last season, but has been putting in some good consistent performances of late. He too is a key part of that Reds' engine room.

3/17/2025,11:56,Liverpool take 'massive momentum' into next fixtures,"The win overBrentfordlast weekend was a massive result for Liverpool, not just because it was three points added but also becauseArsenalplayed after them. Had Liverpool drawn that game, Arsenal would have gone into their game againstAston Villaknowing they could close the gap to four points. We know now that had no effect but it could have caused a change in mentality to Liverpool had the gap been closed. Brentford did not make it easy for Arne Slot's men. They had the correct attitude and approach to the game and they will see conceding the two goals in the final moments as a sucker-punch, but credit to Liverpool as they threw everything at them. No one probably predicted Darwin Nunez to be the hero of the hour and finish his two chances the way he did because he doesn't normally! They were trying everything to get a goal and it was clear from his substitutions that Slot was not going to settle for a draw. That in itself shows the mentality of the players and the manager. I did not expect Liverpool to come away with three points as there was not much in the game but it will give them massive momentum going forward. It is the game we will probably look back at and say 'those points helped them to win the league'. Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Katie Stafford"

The Reds are six points clear at the top of the Premier League with a game in hand and wrapped up qualification to the knockout stage of the Champions League with a game to spare after beating Lille on Tuesday. ""You have to learn from difficult moments and moments that don't go your way,"" Van Dijk said. ""Most of the guys in the dressing room now have experienced last year and that should make you better. It should make you aware of how to deal with certain situations and circumstances, and you should be better equipped. ""At the moment, I am looking at our team and we are very calm. We are working our socks off each and every day, each and every game - and we need everyone fit, healthy and in form. That's the aim.

3/17/2025,12:42,Salah's big Champions League Mo-ments,"As the Reds made it seven wins from seven in this season's Champions League, Mohamed Salah made it 50. A half-century of goals in Europe for the Reds, 45 in the Champions League and five in last season's Europa League campaign. We picked out some of his most memorable strikes. October 2022 - Rangers 1 -7 Liverpool: After starting the game as a substitute, Salah came on in the 68th minute and scored in the 76th, 80th and 81st minutes to notch the quickest hat-trick in Champions League history (6 minutes 12 seconds). June 2019 -Tottenham0-2 Liverpool: In the Champions League final in May 2018, Salah was dragged down to the ground by Sergio Ramos, the master of the dark arts, and the Egypt forwrd had to be substituted with a shoulder injury before the first half was over. A year later, Salah made up for lost time, scoring after two minutes from the penalty spot against Tottenham to send Liverpool on their way to their sixth Champions League title. December 2018 - Liverpool 1-0 Napoli: In a game where Liverpool needed to win by either a clean sheet or two clear goals, Salah squeezed his shot past formerArsenalgoalkeeper David Ospina in the 34rd minute to help the Reds reach the knockout stages. April 2018 - Liverpool 5-2 Roma: Up against his former side in the Champions League semi-final, Salah scored one of his trademark strikes into the far right corner, beating now-team-mate Alisson in the process. He went on to add a second 10 minutes later and registered a further two assists. April 2018 -Manchester City1-2 Liverpool: To set up that meeting with Roma, two weeks earlier Salah had proved instrumental against Manchester City, scoring at Etihad Stadium in a 2-1 win. He also scored in the first leg, as Jurgen Klopp's side cruised through to the semis 5-1 on aggregate. August 2017 - Liverpool 4-2 Hoffenheim: The first of 50. Needing to win across two legs to qualify for the Champions League that season, Salah grabbed his first goal in Europe and first Anfield goal for the Reds to help them to a 6-3 aggregate win over Hoffenheim."
3/17/2025,10:56,Liverpool team 'almost perfect' - Townsend,"Former England midfielder Andros Townsend says Liverpool are an ""almost perfect team"" because of the way they win the ball back and immediately go on the counter-attack. Against Lille on Tuesday, there were goal efforts from all over the pitch as Jarell Quansah and Alexis Mac Allister headed over from set-pieces and Darwin Nunez had a near-post effort saved. ""What impressed me the most about Liverpool in this game was on the turnover and how direct they were to find Nunez and Salah in space,"" said Townsend on BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. ""Not only did they pick them out perfectly, but it was in the perfect moments as Lille were getting momentum and committing men forward. ""It was like win the ball back and then bang, straight away they're looking to put Salah in. That's why they got the first goal. ""It's really impressive how we have this almost perfect Liverpool team."" Listen to the full discussion on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,09:21,Was Salah 'a bit too greedy'?,"Former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock says Mohamed Salah was ""a bit too greedy"" in the Reds2-1 winagainst Lille in the Champions League. Salah scored his 50th European goal for the club as he helped Liverpool book their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with a 100 per cent record. ""I think Liverpool did what they needed to do,"" said Warnock on BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. ""They didn't really get out of first gear. ""Lille were organised and difficult to break down, especially in the first 30 minutes, but Liverpool worked out how to beat their press and went a bit more direct. ""There were times when Salah was going through [on goal] and had it been a bigger or tougher game he might have passed [the ball] in a couple of opportunities that he was maybe a bit greedy with. ""I think he always felt another opportunity would come to him because Lille were not really causing them too many problems."" Listen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,08:35,Liverpool 2-1 Lille - the fans' verdict,We asked for your thoughts afterTuesday's Champions League gamebetween Liverpool and Lille. Here are some of your comments: Tom:Hard-fought win against a well-organised Lille side who are no mugs. We need to cut out these moments of switching off which are costing us in games recently but we managed to get away with it here. Harvey Elliott deserves more minutes and needs to push Dominik Szoboszlai for that number-10 spot. Ian:Really professional performance. Their goal was a gift but we controlled the game well. It was great to give so many players a rest too. We know that we could be pushing on three fronts at the end of the season and that has been our undoing in previous years. Fran:Another disappointing performance from Liverpool and a lucky win against 10 men. They've been extremely lucky this season in all competitions but I suspect that their luck will have run out come the end of the season. Rich:Deservedly top of both the toughest leagues in the world by some distance - but no one wins anything in January.  We go again! Kev:I would like to see Federico Chiesa start againstIpswichor PSV as he looked very lively and a threat. We never really got out of first gear and I think that is in part a credit to Lille who worked extremely hard. Very happy to qualify and miss the round of play-offs. Tricia:Another well managed game from Arne Slot resulting in a comfortable evening. Chiesa's class was obvious even in his small cameo - just hope he can keep clear of injury and play a bigger role going forward.

""I think Slot will be delighted because of the changes that he made for this game, particularly to the back line,"" Warnock told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's a job well done from Liverpool in what could potentially have been a banana skin. ""They were better in the second half and dominant but saw the game out in a professional manner and were quite comfortable in the end. ""It was what Liverpool needed to do and never really got out of first gear to achieve that. They worked out how to beat the Lille press and they caused them problems. ""At the start of the season, not many people knew what to expect of Arne Slot. ""Since Pulisic's goal for AC Milan against them, they have cruised. They have sat back when they need to, and put the foot down when they need to. ""Teams will fear playing Liverpool."""
3/17/2025,23:16,Liverpool 2-1 Lille: Did you know?,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot became just the second manager in Uefa Champions League history to win each of his first seven games in charge of a club, after Hansi Flick with Bayern Munich (won first seven between 2019 and 2021). The Reds have also gone on to win all 22 of the games in which they have opened the scoring under Slot (across all competitions), with 10 of those coming at Anfield."
3/17/2025,23:06,'This league table doesn't tell you anything',"Liverpool boss Arne Slot, speaking to Amazon Prime: ""We are happy that we are top eight. This league table doesn't tell you anything. ""Maybe the number 24 is better than the number 16 but the 16 had an easier draw. We want to be top but we have to wait and see if it's an advantage. ""As a manager, I'm a bit more impressed than the crowd or the people who watch the TV. I knew they were 21 games unbeaten but they beat both Real and Atletico Madrid and they did this without the best players in the world, with the greatest respect. I wasn't happy about one chance conceded and one goal conceded. ""The privilege of managing Liverpool is you have more than 11 good players. You know how tough this competition is and the Premier League and it's up to the players to be ready if they get a chance. His [Harvey Elliott] goal was a lucky goal but his performance was good. On if Liverpool are the best in the world:""No. I think we have a lot of quality and players work really hard. If Thomas Frank says this then it means something. He's been in the Premier League a long time and doesn't have a lot of resources so if he gives this compliment then it is nice. I can come up with five or six teams who are also very good. ""Every time we win it is by small margins. They understand how hard we have to work for a win. Bayern Munich is very good and Barcelona beat Benfica 5-4."""
3/17/2025,22:53,'I'm not leaving - this is my team and my club',"Liverpool midfield Harvey Elliott, speaking to Amazon Prime:""It is hard to put into words. All my life I've dreamt of playing Champions League football, not only for my boyhood club, but to play here at Anfield in front of our fans and especially to score is a pinch me moment. ""The family are here watching down and it is an amazing feeling but it is done now - I need to go into training tomorrow and make sure I'm putting the work in again. On what Slot said to him at half-time:""He just said go out and play and enjoy the game and do it for ourselves really. I wanted to go on and affect the game but also enjoy it. ""I've dreamt as a kid of playing on this stage so I just wanted to enjoy the moment and take it all in my stride and help the team out."" On his celebration:""It is pretty clear to be honest - I am not leaving. This is my team and my club. ""I'm a massive fan and we're in a great position so far this season. I haven't really seen the chat, but my friends have messaged me and called me about a few things. It is always going to happen in January, especially after being out for a long time and not playing as much as I want to, but that is football. ""I've had conversations with the gaffer but, at the same time, I need to understand the situation. The team is flying - we are first in the Premier League and Champions League. For me to go in and say I should be starting it would be silly of myself really. You know what the answer is going to be. ""I need to stay patient and when I am getting opportunities, however long it is, just enjoy the moment, especially after being injured for three months at the start of the season. ""I just want to enjoy my football and when a chance comes I need to show the gaffer that if I am needed I am ready."""
3/17/2025,22:34,Liverpool 2-1 Lille: Is it Elliott's time to get minutes?,"This season has been ""difficult"" for Harvey Elliott, according to Liverpool team-mate Mohamed Salah. The 21-year-old suffered a broken foot early in the season and has been restricted to just substitute appearances in the Premier League and Champions League so far this campaign. He is starting to have an impact though. He assisted Darwin Nunez's second goal at Brentford on Saturday and his deflected strike was the winner here. There has been speculation that Elliott may leave Anfield in the January transfer window but he was quick to shut that down post-match saying ""I'm not leaving - this is my team and my club"". With Liverpool still fighting on all four fronts then Elliott is picking a good time to return to form and lift his output."

I wasn't focused on it before the game. ""They have a really good game plan and they were unbeaten for 21 games so they're a quite tough team. I'm glad we managed to win that game. On his goal:""We got the ball and Curtis [Jones] played the ball very well finally and I managed to score. ""Not switched off but they went to counter-attack and managed to score. The clean sheet is very important to us and our backline. On Harvey Elliott:""He had injuries at the start of the season and it's been difficult for him. I'm always here for him, he's a great lad. When you want to win the biggest tournaments, you need a great squad. On Liverpool squad who won Champions League in 2019:""It's a different manager, different player.

But before speaking about their perfect record in the competition, he responded toBrentfordboss Thomas Frank describing the Reds as the best team in the world. ""His opinion means something to me because he has shown at Brentford how well he has done for so many years without spending crazy amounts of money,"" Slot said. ""But I think it's far too early to say these things.""

3/17/2025,12:25,'A quality player' who 'deserves more game time',"We asked for your views on whether Harvey Elliott and other Liverpool players who are seeing their playing time limited should be getting more minutes, and if Elliott was to be played more, where you would like to see him playing. Here are some of your comments: Andy:Harvey Elliott should be in both the Liverpool and England teams. He is an amazing talent as he showed in pre-season. Phil McNulty has said before that Elliott will be a future England regular and he needs game time to achieve that. I hope Slot doesn't waste this young and exceptional talent. Rhona:Last season Harvey really made the engine tick going forward. I was devastated last week when he was linked with a transfer to Borussia Dortmund. He loves Liverpool, he is young and he is a future captain. Fraser:Arne Slot has done really well so far and I'm really happy with him but if there's one thing that I think he could improve on it is that he needs to start trusting some of his players more. Harvey Elliott was really good for us in the last few seasons and he has shown that he wants to be part of the team. Elliott is a lot better going forward than Curtis Jones is. Jones is good but he's much better playing further back and with possession than he is playing forward. Elliott should be our main back-up to Szoboszlai. Not just Elliott, it's the same with Federico Chiesa and Endo - Slot needs to trust them and give them minutes to develop. They are good players. Paul:It's an interesting one. Klopp conceded that he didn't use Harvey enough, and Slot seems even more reluctant. For me, he never has a bad game and is a quality player who should be given more minutes. Yusuf:Elliott should play more - now that teams know that we attack using Gakpo and Salah on the flanks, using Elliott in the central attacking midfield spot for Szoboszlai and Jones at times will make attacks more fluid, and he can apply that killer pass to the wingers and catch defenders sleeping. Don't forget that he does get the odd goal from outside the box as well. Sam:100% agree with Jordan Chamberlain (BBC Sport fan writer) about Harvey Elliott. He changed the game at Brentford with two exquisite passes leading to goals when the game was heading for a potentially-costly stalemate. He deserves more game time as he offers something different to the Liverpool team with his vision and creativity."
3/17/2025,12:09,Have two key players already signed?,"Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler has revealed an interesting theory over the much-publicised contract negotiations going on at the club. The Reds face losing captain Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold for free this summer as all three are set to be out of contract. The situation has garnered attention in spades given the high-profile nature of each player and their obvious contribution to a club topping the Premier League table. Speaking to Amazon Prime, Fowler said: ""I do have a little theory. I don't know if this is so far from the truth. I just think two of them have signed already. Maybe one hasn't. But then the simple fact is the club can't come out and say 'you two have signed' as it makes the other one look worse. ""I think there's a possibility that may have happened. If two sign and the club come out and say, it puts so much pressure on the other one."""

3/17/2025,17:35,Why Slot should now use Elliott more,"Darwin Nunez got the headlines on Saturday, and rightly so, but Harvey Elliott also made a massive impact off the bench. The 21-year-old was involved in both goals in what was his most telling contribution of the season. He has not had many chances this term, with Arne Slot preferring Dom Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones at number 10. Elliott got injured early on and has never been able to force his way in, tellingly not even coming off the bench in the 1-1 draw atNottingham Forestlast week. AtBrentford,though, Slot gave him 10 minutes - and Elliott changed the game, proving himself as a creative force. The midfielder found spaces between the lines and showed an ability to make intricate passes into the penalty area. Szoboszlai is a better presser and more physical, while Jones is good at retaining possession, but Elliott has superior vision to both. Hopefully, Slot will now use him more, especially against teams who park the bus, because Elliott has the ability to find attackers in the box instead of just spreading the play wide every time. Jones has now got himself in the England squad, and if Elliott gets the minutes his talent deserves, he could too by the end of the season. Do you think Elliott should be getting more game time, Reds fans? Where should Slot be using him? Are there any others who should be getting more minutes? And if so, in what games?

3/17/2025,17:35,Was this Mane all over again?,"Liverpool fans often point to the sight of an overjoyed Sadio Mane running towards a raucous away end atAston Villain November of 2019 as the moment they truly ended their long title wait. The Reds needed months to confirm the honour but for many, the race was won when that glancing header beat Villa at the death. On such moments, momentum becomes an avalanche and titles are clinched. Saturday's added-time drama atBrentfordcontained its fair share of delirium, not to mention an eye-catching moment that has fans talking. Was this the Mane header all over again? When Darwin Nunez applied his finish in the 91st minute, the Uruguayan threw his shirt into the air and led a pack of chasing team-mates to the corner flag, where the Reds' travelling fans were losing their minds. The footage of the celebrationshas become a viral social media hit,, externalwith Federico Chiesa's eyes-wide joy a prominent feature and Harvey Elliott playing a starring role. Elliott sprints after Nunez, picks up the striker's tossed shirt from the floor and in a rhythmic, almost poetic manner, boots a pitchside ball high into the bouncing away end. On a day when 37 shots had been fired at the Brentford goal, at the end of a week when Nunez was discussed at length by pundits expecting his imminent departure, and after a run of days where the word ""blip"" was used perhaps more than it should have been, Elliott's swipe punched through the January air, as roars poured down at him, his jubilant team-mates and a striker reborn for perhaps the fifth, sixth or seventh time in his Anfield career. Following Mane's Villa Park header, Liverpool won 16 league games in a row. Reds fans will hope Nunez's moment and Elliott's big boot prove to be as influential and, one day, as iconic."

The Reds are six points clear at the top of the Premier league with a game in hand and three points clear at the top of the new League Phase of the Champions League with two games remaining - starting on Tuesday evening against Lille. Arne Slot's side also have the best defensive record in both competitions, conceding just one goal in their European matches so far and 20 in their 21 domestically. When asked in the pre-match news conference if his partnership with Van Dijk is the best in Europe, Konate said: ""This season, yeah I think so. Everybody knows Virgil, everybody knows his quality. For me he is the best, no-one is better than him in this position. ""I learn a lot from him and from other players like [Joel] Matip, Joe [Gomez] and others who play this position as well. ""I never said it to him [Van Dijk] but I have said in interviews, I just want to be better than him one day! ""That's why I work hard, to reach this level one day.""

Here are the key lines from his news conference: Slot said both Diogo Jota and Joe Gomez are expected to be back in ""weeks not months"" with Jota, who he said has overloaded a shoulder muscle, is expected to be back ""a bit earlier than Joe"". He believes Darwin Nunez has the potential to kick on after his double againstBrentford: ""The most difficult thing in football is to find consistency. Only a few players in the world are able to be at the same level every three days in a row. Next step for him is if he can go into the bracket of players who are outstanding every three days. It's a nice challenge for him."" On Bees boss Thomas Frank's comments that the Reds are the best team in the world: ""His opinion means something to me because he has shown at Brentford how well he has done for so many years without spending crazy amounts of money. But I think it's far too early to say these things. The Champions League format is different. We have to face a lot of teams."" Slot is not over concerned by finishing top of the League Phase table: ""The most important, when we go out there we want to win a game. I'm not thinking at the league table in a way that if you finish number one you get the easiest team because being on top doesn't tell you you're the best team. It's impossible to say because of the strange format we have."" On improving attacking output: ""We have scored more in the last eight, nine games. We've conceded a few too so we've needed these goals more than in the beginning of the season. I can't come up with why it has changed but we are working together and know even better what we want with the ball."" On Tuesday's opponents: ""I am not surprised but impressed.

3/17/2025,14:26,'There are teams who can catch Liverpool',"BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty has been answering your questions. Joe asked:Are people trying to create a title race when there isn't one? All available evidence points to Liverpool by at least eight points. Phil answered:There is still a title race because there are teams who can catch Liverpool,and they have to believe they can, but it would take quite the change for Arne Slot's team not to win the Premier League now. Arsenaltook astep forward againstTottenhamthen a step back againstAston Villa, and whileNottingham Forestare having a remarkable season under Nuno Espirito Santo, I cannot put my hand on my heart and say I think they will win the title. If Forest get into Europe, even the Champions League, then that will be an incredible achievement alone. Manchester Cityare simply too far back now."
3/17/2025,09:23,Brentford 0-2 Liverpool - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between Brentford and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Brentford fans: George:Thomas Frank talked about finally being able to go toe-to-toe with a top-side after the draw against City - you can't say we didn't do that again. The final four minutes will have absolutely crushed the team's spirit. I hope the fans and staff are able to build it back up again quickly - playing like that versus any other team in the league would have given us three points. Uzzi:About as cruel an ending you could expect. Played so well against an excellent side, had some good openings but the penny just didn't drop. Always felt one goal would settle it, unfortunately it wasn't for us. Will:We held on and held on and held on but could not get over the line. We did admirably having played City just four days ago. Can't help but wonder if perhaps a couple more subs were needed (Mee for Mads? Rico for KLP? Carvalho for Wissa?). We could have maybe put more fresh legs on and had a better chance. A good game with a disappointing result but we go again… COYB! Ben:Could clearly see the tiredness from an amazing game on Tuesday took its toll. But still so proud of another strong performance against a top side. Even with key players missing we still manage to be competitive. Credit to the manager, coaching team and the players. Keane Lewis-Potter (a winger) playing at full-back and keeping Salah quiet the entire game has to be one of the defensive performances of the season. Liverpool fans: Rob:Nunez man of the hour, could not be happier for him. Szobo was also excellent, as were the back four. Credit to Brentford - they defended very well, often getting the better of our starting front three. Sean:What a surprise end to that game! Nunez is certainly a workhorse but he needs to keep that end product coming else he'll be gone soon. The fact that Alisson and Trent were by far the stand out players is quite a concern. Midfield seemed baffled by the low block. Salah was hardly noticeable (hasn't been for a few games now), while Diaz and Gakpo hold on for too long. Chiesa and Jota need to be starting games. Bench Salah. George:Great energy and intensity with lots of possession. Needed to be more clinical in the last third. Seem to struggle to find a way through teams with a low block. Mo seemed very quiet, not making so many telling runs into the box. I thought Trent played well. We need to work on set pieces as we had so many corners and never looked like capitalising. Substitutions worked well. We deserved the win but it could easily have got away from us. Yusuf:A solid display and one that was much needed after the past few matches. Credit to Nunez - won us the game and has eliminated all questions over his confidence. Something to note though - all players celebrated after the final whistle and went over to the fans but Mohamed Salah. Has transfer speculation affected him over the past few games?"
3/17/2025,08:33,Slot 'remarkable' but title not 'done and dusted',"The title race is not over but Liverpool's determination in the final minutes of the game againstBrentfordwill help them to continue their hunt for silverware. That's the view of former Premier League striker Glenn Murray, who has heaped praise on manager Arne Slot during a weekend where his side moved six points clear at the top of the Premier League with a game in hand on their closest rivals. ""There is real belief in the squad that they are going to win and win the title,"" said former Premier League striker Glenn Murray on the BBC Radio 5 Live Football Daily podcast. ""Slot has got a wonderful balance to this side and he is getting more out of certain players than Jurgen Klopp would have done. ""What he has done in such a short space of time is remarkable, plus he has managed the contract situations [of Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold] perfectly because that could easily disrupt a dressing room. ""I think Liverpool will go on to win the title but there will be a blip along the road, so it's not a case of the race being done and dusted."" Listen to the Football Daily podcast on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,08:01,'Slot looked like he was trying to solve a puzzle',"It was very interesting watching the Liverpool technical area on Saturday. Just as Arne Slot has imposed a different style on this Liverpool team when compared to Jurgen Klopp's approach, so to does he cut a completely different kind of figure on the touchline. There were very occasional flashes of frustration and even anger from Slot, but in general his demeanour is calm, his instructions to staff and players methodical and composed. Klopp would have been leaping around, gesturing and yelling watching his team fail to score despite 30-odd shots, but Slot looked like he was trying to solve a puzzle. This isn't meant as praise or criticism of either manager. Merely an observation that Liverpool's steadier, more patient build-up appears to be a reflection of the personality of their (relatively) new boss."

3/17/2025,17:37,'Nunez always has a lot of impact',"Liverpool boss Arne Slot told BBC Sport after today's win:""During the season you're hoping for these moments. Many moments - we could have scored a late winner against United, Forest, Fulham. Today it worked. We managed to score in the last few seconds. ""We were close to not getting what we deserved. The amount of chances we created was like on Tuesday against Forest - a lot. We were close to going off without a win. That combined with a late winner is what we were most happy about. And it was a significant game."" On Darwin Nunez:""He's always having a lot of impact when he comes in. Brings energy and power. Most of our games are the last half hour in control around 18 yards, and that's where he's at his best. The first hour is often open but the last 30 minutes dominant. Then to have someone like Darwin is nice to have. ""I don't only look at results. We created a lot. But now it's a win so I don't have to say look at our performance. I was very pleased with our performance. Brentford made it a fight. They have good players and a good game plan. It was a nice game to watch like every time Liverpool are on the pitch."""
3/17/2025,17:22,Brentford 0-2 Liverpool: Did you know?,"Since his first Premier League campaign in 2022-23, only Jhon Duran (eight) has scored more goals as a substitute than Liverpool's Darwin Nunez (seven), while he has more goal involvements as a substitute than any other player (11). Liverpool's 37 shots against Brentford is their joint-most in a Premier League game on record (since 2003-04), also doing so againstEvertonin April 2016. The Reds failed to score with any of their first 35 shots in today's game, before netting with their final two through Darwin Nunez."
3/17/2025,17:19,'This season will definitely be a bumpy ride',"Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk told BBC Sport after today's victory:""It was a lot of hard work. Brentford away is a difficult place to come. The way they press high, eventally going to a low block and the quality they have on the break. We did well. We kept working, kept trying. Eventually Darwin made a difference with the two goals. ""We've experienced it two games in a row - especially the second half against Forest. It's also quality from Brentford that they want you to try to force it a bit because they'll get you on the break. We did well and limited them. ""Darwin since the day he came in he brings a lot of energy. As a striker you're judged by your goals. Maybe it's tougher than ever. He's working hard and learning. Today he had a massive part of the victory. It was well deserved. ""Today was a small piece of the puzzle. We have to keep going."" On Darwin Nunez's double:""You have to earn these things. As a striker you get judged on goals especially at a club like Liverpool. Today he put his mark on the game. Very important. We need everyone at their best. Today was his day."" Were they at their best?""I think so, yeah. Don't you think so?"" ""They have a very clear structure. You try to break a low block down and if you lose the ball sometimes you can get a counter-attack on you. They create some danger moments. They create them against any team in the league. We handled it well and could have scored more. ""There is no walk in the park. Every game, teams are very good. They want to play their best game against us like we want to play our best game against them. ""If nobody is ready for a bumpy ride then this season will definitely be one."""

3/17/2025,11:15,Sutton's predictions: Brentford v Liverpool,"I thought Liverpool were really unlucky not to beatNottingham Foreston Tuesday. They played well had enough chances to win, but Forest keeper Matz Sels made some excellent saves. Now, withArsenalwinning on Wednesday, this game has become massive for Liverpool. If they don't win it, people are going to really question them. Arne Slot's side have drawn their past two league games, and lost toTottenhamin the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final. So, since the turn of they year they have only won one game in four - the home FA Cup tie against Accrington. It is something of a mini-blip for them, and they need to get back on track. But they are still where they want to be - four points clear at the top of the Premier League and with a game in hand on the teams below them. This is going to be another tough game for the leaders, though. People might see Brentford's late comeback againstManchester Cityas justification for them resting players in their FA Cup home defeat byPlymouth. I disagree with that, but the Bees have shown this season that they never lie down and I can see them scoring and keeping this close. Unlike City, though, I believe Liverpool will find a way of getting over the line. Sutton's prediction:1-2 Read the full predictions and have your say here"
3/17/2025,18:27,Slot wants more late winners from Liverpool,"Liverpool have seen their Premier League lead reduced to four points byArsenaland, while Reds boss Arne Slot wasn't showing any signs of being ruffled when he spoke to the media on Friday, he did highlight an aspect of his side's play he would like to see improved in the second half of the season. Having been held to draws byNewcastle United,Fulham,Manchester UnitedandNottingham Forestin four of their past seven league games, Slot wants his players to take their chances late on in tight encounters. ""One of the things I would like us to do better in the second half of the season than the first half, although it wasn't necessary that many times, is to make a late goal winner,"" said the Dutchman before his side's game atBrentfordon Saturday (15:00 GMT). ""Hopefully we don't come to these situations a lot but we definitely, if we are coming in those situations, have one, two or three times a moment where we do score in the last minute of the game when we deserve it."" Liverpool have a game in hand over Arsenal and play before the Gunners kick-off againstAston Villaat 17:30 on Saturday. However, Slot said he was staying focused on his job at Liverpool rather than looking at his rivals or the league table. ""I didn't even know they [Arsenal] were playing later than us. I only look at the opponent we have to face and I know that is a tough one,"" he added. ""I don't think we are thinking about the league table as much as the media are. We are trying to get the best out of the players and the players are trying to get the best out of themselves every single day. ""These players know how long the season still is and how many games they need to be in the best possible form to win something at the end of the season, which is not something that happens every season. ""We are not so focused on the league table as other people are."""
3/17/2025,17:41,Is Szoboszlai a key improvement factor?,"Liverpool's second-half endeavour in their draw atNottingham Forestsaw them end the game with a central midfielder at centre-back, full-backs playing as wingers and a healthy 23 shots on a night where Arne Slot showed an abundance of creativity and adventure. The Reds' attacking output has been stellar - with 48 goals a league high by a distance. The question is, as they near a junction in their season where finding a fraction more in the locker could draw them away from a chasing pack, where might such small margins be hiding? Almost every attacking player is exceeding their xG - with Mohamed Salah frontrunning on 18 goals from an expected 16.94. Luis Diaz - eight goals from an xG of 5.28 - and Cody Gakpo - six from an xG of 3.88 - are outperforming by a margin. The only player not hitting their xG is Dominik Szoboszlai, with two goals from an expected 4.31. Is this small slither of data an area where Slot's side can find crucial improvement? In the Hungarian's defence, he has created 28 chances in the Premier League this season, figures only bettered by Salah (42) and Trent Alexander-Arnold (37). He can question the finishing of others as to why only two of those chances have turned into assists. Ultimately, extracting more from Szoboszlai seems an obvious pathway to improvement - both in his own finishing and in how others process what he tees up. In pondering what or who can improve, the Reds must make sure so many players continue to outperform as the graph above displays. And ultimately, if anyone can make a leap to get anywhere near the 31 combined goals and assists Salah has delivered, the Reds will be almost impossible to stop. Diaz - on a humble 10 by comparison - sits second in the ranking. Salah has trebled the critical output of his nearest counterpart. If anyone finds a burst of form to narrow the gap to him, a 20th league title would be all but guaranteed."
3/17/2025,16:22,Nunez not struggling with confidence - Slot,"Is Darwin Nunez low on confidence?

3/17/2025,15:49,Brentford v Liverpool: Did you know?,"Liverpool have conceded the first goal in five of their past seven Premier League games, having done so in just three of their first 13 this season. However, they have not lost any of these matches, recovering to win once and draw four."
3/17/2025,13:55,'We compete with teams spending incredible amounts' - Slot,"Arne Slot is thrilled Liverpool are ""still able to compete"" as Premier League rivalsManchester Cityflex their financial muscles over star striker Erling Haaland. With the Norwegian striker signing a new nine-and-a-half year contract, it shows a huge contrast as to what is happening on Merseyside with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Virgil Van Dijk and Mo Salah all on course to be free agents in the summer. The weekly wage cost of Liverpool's three stars is £750,000, whereas it is reported Haaland's new deal will be two thirds of that alone. And, with City reportedly expected to splurge over £150m in this transfer window and Liverpool unlikely to make a significant deal, it begs the question of whether their own position in English football's pecking order is at risk. This was asked to Slot in Friday's news conference before the Reds' weekend game at Brentford, and he replied: ""Not particularly about the investment but we know how good we have to be every single day to compete in this league. ""It is not only the club you are referring to,Chelseaalso spend £1.2bn, (Manchester)Unitedspend an incredible amount. ""Every team spends a lot of money over here, that's why it's such an interesting league to be part of. ""Some seasons this club spends a bit more, other seasons other clubs spend a bit more. That's what makes this league so intense and so difficult to win. ""But that's also the reason why we want to be here. You want to compete against the best, with the best, and we are very happy with the team we have at the moment and we are still able to compete with all the teams that are spending incredible amounts of money."""
3/17/2025,13:36,Jota 'niggle' shouldn't stop loan move for Danns,"This video can not be played  Liverpool head coach Arne Slot confirmed Diogo Jota ""felt a little niggle"" in Tuesday's game againstNottingham Forestand is now a doubt for Saturday's trip toBrentford. However, the forward's latest injury is unlikely to hinder a potential loan move for academy star Jayden Danns, who has done ""really well"" when called upon. Slot still feels he has an adequate number of players available."
3/17/2025,12:25,Haaland's contract 'grates for a few reasons',"Being a Liverpool fan, fighting againstManchester Cityhas often felt like we are competing on an un-level playing field. They spent brilliantly to dominate the Premier League, but could buy with impunity. A £50m full-back does not work out? No problem, they just get another. Liverpool would not get away with spending huge money on Kalvin Philipps and Mathueus Nunes, for example. If we stumped up £100m on this pair, that would be it - the midfield budget gone. So Erling Haaland's new contract grates for a few reasons. Firstly, Liverpool's own superstars have not had their deals renewed. FSG are haggling over the money and length of terms and we might lose Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk. Three of the best players on the planet. City though, despite being in a rut, extend Haaland for a decade. Secondly, City have endured their first poor run in a very long time and immediately, Pep Guardiola is given money to fix it. Claudio Echeverri has come in, with Omar Marmoush and Abdukodir Khusanov arriving shortly in what could be a £100m+plus January spend. Liverpool are crying out for defensive reinforcements but the right opportunity just does not arise. Thirdly, Haaland's renewal suggests City are extremely confident their punishment for the 115 charges will be minimal. After all, why would the Norwegian commit his whole career to a club facing potential relegation? Liverpool need a win againstBrentford, badly. And a contract or transfer announcement, however unlikely, would be nice, too. Find more from Jordan Chamberlain atEmpire of the Kop, external"
3/17/2025,10:08,"Slot on Jota's injury, Nunez's confidence and Brentford","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game againstBrentford(kick-off 15:00 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Diogo Jota ""is going to struggle"" after feeling ""a niggle"" in the draw toNottingham Forest. He did not train on Thursday. Meanwhile, Luis Diaz, who also did not train yesterday, is expected to be fine having only missed the session with a sore throat. Slot said he expect a ""tough game"" against Brentford, acknowledging there ""has been a lot to prepare"" his players for after analysing their style and ""many strengths"". On what he expects from the Bees: ""They have a high press going man to man and can defend in a low block. They can score goals in all sort of ways, are a threat from set-pieces and can score in the first seconds."" He said his team ""don't think about the league table every single day"" like the media do and his players ""know how long the season is and how they have to be in their best form to win a trophy."" On an upcoming busy schedule: ""It has been a double programme week since the Champions League started. It is what makes the Premier League the hardest league in the world to compete in. But we have tried to prepare them in pre-season for this. They are completely fit and ready."" He disagreed that Darwin Nunez is low on confidence and said ""it is the life of a striker that sometimes you score and sometimes you don't."" Slot added: ""We  have so many goals in our team and Darwin will score like he has in the past for this club. I don't see him struggling that much."" On Diaz playing more centrally given Cody Gakpo's form on the left-hand-side: ""He has done really well as a nine. I am happy with how he does as a left-winger or a nine. He has scored many goals in either [position]."" He said Liverpool's lack of clean sheets in recent games is ""not a concern but it's also not what we want"" as they compete for the title. Striker Jayden Danns could still move away from Anfield on loan in this transfer window despite Jota's new injury: ""We do already have three options and we don't expect Jota to be out for a long period of time. Jayden did really well when he came in but it's up to us as the club to make the decision for him now and for the club in the long term."" On whether he is concerned about the lack of goals from substitutes: ""No, because there are not many times where they've needed to affect the game with a goal. One of the things I would like us to do better is to have a late winner. There were a few games where we created chance after chance to score a winner - and we haven't.""

3/17/2025,07:48,Salah's future back in the spotlight,"Mohamed Salah's future is back in the spotlight with the Liverpool forward  apparently being targeted by the Saudi Pro League again. To add to the speculation, Turki Alashikh, who is a huge figure in Saudi Arabian sport and has helped make some of boxing's biggest fights, posted a mocked-up picture on social media of Salah in an Al-Hilal shirt. Liverpool manager Arne Slot has fielded plenty of questions about the future of Salah and he will probably be asked about him again when he chats to the media at 09:15 GMT, prior to his side's game atBrentfordon Saturday. If somehow you had not heard, Salah's contract, like that of team-mates Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk, runs out in the summer and the trio have been able to talk to international clubs since the start of January. When it comes to on-pitch issues, Liverpool have seen their lead at the top of the Premier League reduced to four points byArsenal, who have played a game more. It follows the Reds having won three games and drawn four from their past seven league outings in a run has included just one clean sheet and given their rivals hope that they can be caught. They were held to a 1-1 draw atNottingham Foreston Tuesday and we will also hear what Slot has to say about the situation. The Reds will want to quickly get back to winning ways to reassert their authority, but that could be easier said than done. The Bees came back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 againstManchester Cityat home on Tuesday and have one of the best home record's in the top flight this season. One of the team selection decisions that Slot faces is over Diogo Jota. The Portugal international scored the equaliser at Forest 22 seconds after coming on and has a strong case to start."

3/17/2025,14:17,'May be time for Kelleher' or 'can't believe we're considering the question?',"We asked for your views on whether you would like to see Caoimhin Kelleher return in place of Alisson, and whether the Brazilian's form was declining or if he was just having a blip. Here are some of your comments: Roger:Kelleher was unlucky to lose his place when Ali returned to fitness. Ali has made the odd mistake since his return and the way Kelleher was performing in Ali's absence (the third goal vNewcastleaside) does make me wonder if one or two of the goals we conceded since Ali's return may have been prevented. It's a tough decision for Slot, but I would have kept Kelleher in. Rick:It may indeed be time to give Kelleher a decent run in the side. He's a great keeper and deserves his chance, especially due to the patience he has shown and for being a team player. It's not so much the number of goals that Alisson has conceded, but there are other errors creeping into his game, especially with the ball at his feet. His positioning is sometimes questionable and ball handling doesn't seem to be quite as good as it was previously. While the goals he's conceded since coming back into the team may not be a direct consequence of errors, it may only be a matter of time before this happens which could be in a very important game or at an important moment in a game that has a missive impact on a result. Keith:I am always more nervous when Alisson is in goal. I feel that Kelleher has done more than enough in the games he's played to be first choice and given his age he has to be the future for the team. Rich:Can't believe we're even considering the question. Alisson is the best goalkeeper in the world while Kelleher is the best number two in the world. Hope we're able to hang onto both as Alisson does tend to pick up an injury a couple of times a season. Ken:As with any position in the Liverpool team, there is competition for places. We can see this clearly demonstrated, and working really well, with the plethora of strikers and midfielders being rotated regularly. The goalkeeping position should now also be open to this, given how strong Kelleher is. Alisson is still the number one but Slot must pick on form, rather than sentiment. Give Kelleher a shot to try and claim the position - he's too good to stay on the bench and possibly leave the club. Alex:As a Liverpool fan I love Alisson, he's saved us on so many occasions, not to mention scoring that header againstWest Bromto secure a Champions League spot. However, I would give Kelleher a run of games, dropping Alisson to the bench. The same way I expected Southgate to select his England players based on form, I'd like Slot to start the best performing goalkeeper, despite Alisson being one of the Premier League's all-time greats."
3/17/2025,11:52,Is it time for Kelleher to be given his chance?,"On Tuesday night,Nottingham Foreststriker Chris Wood was slid down the side of Virgil van Dijk. The shot was on target but the angle was tight and the Liverpool captain looked unconcerned. Nottingham Forest's top scorer is undoubtedly on a hot streak and his effort was well placed, albeit lacking power off his weaker side. Regardless, it was good enough to beat a sprawling Alisson and put Liverpool behind in a Premier League match. Again. Since Alisson joined in July 2018, he has been Liverpool's undisputed number one – a critical component in the spine of Jurgen Klopp's most successful sides. However, this season, legitimate questions are being asked about his position, especially with his replacement Caiomhin Kelleher performing so well in his absence. Take the expected goals against (xGA) metric. That Wood shot registered only 0.16 but still went in. In fact, as the chart shows, in Alisson's 12 games this season, the data suggests he has conceded more than he ought, shipping 11 goals from an xGA of 8.58. On the flipside, Kelleher has performed better – his xGA being more than the number of goals he has let in. It is a similar story with save percentage as Kelleher's 71% outweighs his more illustrious colleague. There is also the question of how Liverpool's goals have been conceded. Yes, Alisson was between the posts for their fine start this season, with only one goal shipped in the first four. When he got injured at the start of October, Kelleher let in fewer than one a game until allowing Newcastle to score three in his final game before Alisson returned. Nine goals given up in six games since the Brazil keeper rejoined the team lends further credence to those who say Kelleher deserves his chance as Liverpool number one. But what do you think? Would you like to see Kelleher in goal for Liverpool? Is Alisson's form declining or is this just a blip? Let us know"

Ryan Gravenberch has been absolutely exceptional, but the alternative in that position is not ideal. ""If Tyler Morton was allowed to leave, there is definitely scope to add somebody of a similar profile to Gravenberch - maybe a little bit younger. ""I take Arne Slot's point [of Liverpool not desperately needing a new signing] - he is the head coach and not the manager, and I think that is quite telling when it comes to the transfer talk.

Van Dijk jokes after latest draw,"Virgil van Dijk says Liverpool's recent run of three wins in seven games in all competitions proves the strength of English football rather than the Reds are struggling. A 1-1 draw at second-placedNottingham Foreston Tuesday came after a home draw withManchester Unitedin the Premier League, while last Wednesday they lost atTottenhamin the Carabao Cup. ""So are we in a crisis now?"" said the central defender. ""It only confirms the Premier League is a very tough league where you play against opponents who are very good. ""Every game is tough - we have to find a way to win. We have been outstanding the whole season with everything we have been doing.

3/17/2025,14:03,'Genuine belief remains Reds can rediscover form and deliver dreams',"Liverpool's draw atNottingham Foresthad all the hallmarks of two teams at the top of their game, playing out a six-pointer at the top of the table. Make no mistake, Nuno Espirito Santo's team are a serious contender for a Champions League position based on the evidence they provided on Tuesday. The crowd was right up for it and created the noise that allowed their team to take an early lead and really trouble their opponents in several spells throughout the game. Arne Slot's team started well, but were too easily picked apart for the goal and there are definitely some concerns in the manner in which the Reds are both starting games and being cut apart by any opponent worth their salt over the past few weeks. They will need to ensure they send out another statement when they visitBrentford,in order to further cement their position as the league leaders. Liverpool have given themselves leeway to drop points against teams either  in-form teams with belief, like Forest andManchester United.However, they cannot afford to rest on their laurels and think the competition is out of sight. It would be nice to see the Reds strengthen in January to bring a little more solidity at the back, but there is still a genuine belief they can rediscover their early season form and deliver all of our wildest dreams in May.

3/17/2025,08:54,Nottingham Forest 1-1 Liverpool - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts after Tuesday's Premier League game between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Forest fans Peter:Superb in the first half, wilted in the second versus a relentless Liverpool team. Shame it was such a soft goal to concede but a draw is certainly decent. Superb atmosphere as well. John:Outstanding organisation, effort and flair in attack. There are so many key players all playing for each other.  Elliot Anderson is a bit of an unsung hero. Don't know whyNewcastlelet him go but thank you! Doug:A good result for both teams. In a strange way, as a Forest fan, it is a new era feeling a bit disappointed not coming away with the win. Well done, you Reds. Liverpool fans Ken:Slot has done very little wrong since taking the helm, but while he prefers a more measured approach, it is repeatedly throwing up these tepid first halves. The tempo is woefully slow and the passing laborious. It allows the opposition to stay compact. Credit for the eventual changes in the second half, which paid instant dividends and completely changed the flow of the game. Yusuf:It was a game that was a tactical battle in the first half and an absolute cracker in the second. We knew that it would be difficult to score, but our build-up play was good. Wasn't to be Mohamed Salah or Luis Diaz's day, but a step in the right direction. Being able to not get beaten, even if it is a draw, has set Liverpool apart from others this season, particularly against the teams near us at the top. A well-deserved draw for both teams in the end. Lewis:The games are getting harder week by week. I don't think it was great but another hard-won point. I'd give 7/10 for the performance."
3/17/2025,08:01,'Top managers make big decisions',"""That is what happens when you are a top manager,"" said BBC Radio 5 Live pundit Clinton Morrison. ""You make big decisions."" Arne Slot's double change in the 66th minute, replacing Andrew Robertson and Ibrahima Konate with Diogo Jota and Kostas Tsimikas, is probably his most crucial choice of substitutes yet. Just 22 seconds later, Tsimikas whipped in a corner that found Jota's head six yards out to draw Liverpool level atNottingham Forest. Reds' fastest substitute goal since 2006-07 in a Premier League match. Slot was not keen so take the plaudits at full-time and played it down: ""If it had been open play then people could maybe say it was a tactical masterclass, but it was a set-piece so I don't think I deserve any credit for that. ""It was a substitution where we brought an attacker on for a defender and the fact it immediately led to a goal you could say was luck."" But Jota said he and fellow sub Tsimikas went on with the intention to combine and score: ""We were watching the cup goal from a few years ago where he passed it to me - so when we were on the touchline, we said: ""Let's go now and recreate that, you take the corner. And it was a goal."""

3/17/2025,23:56,'We must not get a habit of not getting what we deserved',"Liverpool manager Arne Slot, speaking to BBC Sport:""I am a little bit disappointed, although when you're 1-0 down against Nottingham Forest it is maybe a lot to ask for a win because they've hardly given away any chances in the recent games that they have played. ""That is why I couldn't ask for more from our players. They created so many chances in the second half but to not score from all of those chances was a little disappointing of course."" On Matz Sels:""He was also like this at Anfield, but also all season. It isn't just their goalkeeper, but the way they defended and because of that maybe they deserved to not concede a second or third goal because they threw themselves for every ball and cross. They fight with everything they've got and the fans were really loud and helped them a lot. ""Still, we managed to create more than a few chances to score and that is what pleased me most and maybe, not for the first time this season, we didn't get what we deserved."" On what changed in the second half:""We were a bit more patient in the second half. Maybe the intensity was a little bit higher but maybe the other team is a little bit more tired too."" On the Jota and Tsimikas substitutions:""I just wanted to bring more attacking threat to the team and the fact we scored immediately was just a bonus."" On the result as a whole:""We should be disappointed, although they are having a great season. We want to win every game and they probably want to win every game as well. With how the game went I think we can be disappointed. ""They are a counter-attacking team and I think we only conceded one counter-attack and for us to come from behind shows the character and quality the team has. We must not get a habit of not getting what we deserved because it happened at Tottenham and it happened today and the analysts might not agree but based on expected goals we deserved more than 2-2 draw against Manchester United too."""

On combining with fellow substitute Konstantinos Tsimikas for the goal:""We were watching the cup goal from a few years ago where he [Tsimikas] passed it to me and so when we were on the touchline we said: 'Let's go now and recreate that, you take the corner' - and it was a goal. ""It was one of those occasions where everything went right. But like I said, I am not happy because I think we could have won."" On Matz Sels' performance:""I was just telling that to my former coaches from Wolves just now. He made two or three great saves. You want to do better but he was good as well.""

3/17/2025,16:48,Nunez or Danns? The fans' verdict,"We asked for your views on has Jayden Danns done enough to deserve selection ahead of Darwin Nunez? Here are some of your comments: Bryan:Nunez has had plenty of opportunities at Liverpool. It is clear to everybody that he isn't a natural finisher, and adds very little to the team apart from his energetic style. He is becoming a liability. Fortunately for Liverpool, the misses he has had haven't mattered, but at some point they will. Danns took his chance, and should be back-up to the front four of Cody Gakpo, Luis Diaz, Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah. Iain:While Nunez is a Liverpool player he should be used but only for specific parts of games - unless he suddenly finds better form. Younger players need to be managed carefully and not overused but built up over time. Plenty of room for both to play. Ged:Danns looks the part - he seems to have the striker's knack to be in the right place, plus the coolness to finish. Liverpool have been very patient with Nunez. However, he now needs to step to one side for Danns. Ian:As much as I like the idea Nunez will turn out good, it is not going to happen for him at Anfield. We don't play the type of football that suits his game. We need a proper number nine to complement the rest of our attacking options. Jota can't play in every game and any pressure that is taken from Salah's shoulders has to be a good thing. Al:I'm a massive Nunez fan but I really don't think we can afford to keep playing him. His confidence is shot - even Danns looks a better bet. Need to send him out on loan maybe or cash in. Roger:Nunez has had his chances and missed all of them. Danns looks like he could do the job if given the opportunity."

3/17/2025,11:56,Should Slot now pick Danns over Nunez?,"Jayden Danns has played about 100 minutes of professional football for Liverpool. In that time, he has scored three goals. The Scouser came off the bench against Accrington Stanley on Saturday and did more in 20 minutes than Darwin Nunez did in 90. It is about time Arne Slot seriously considers selecting Danns ahead of Nunez, who has had enough chances to prove himself as a proper Liverpool number nine. He misses chances. His head goes down. He makes bad decisions and you never, ever trust him in big moments. Nunez is the only player to noticeably regress under Slot. With Jurgen Klopp in charge, Nunez was inconsistent and chaotic, but he still scored 18 goals last season. Halfway through this term, he only has two. Not a Liverpool fan? Find your club's page here Danns is confident, composed and just looks a much better finisher than the Uruguayan. Really, Liverpool need a new number nine and to sell Nunez to the highest bidder - but until then, Danns deserves opportunities. He can also hold the ball up and press, and has physical traits which belie his 18 years. If Slot is not going to use Danns, then a Championship loan should be sanctioned. Ideally, though, he will stay and start the FA Cup fourth-round tie atPlymouthand hopefully the two Champions League dead rubbers coming up at the end of this month.

3/17/2025,10:33,Sutton's predictions: Nottingham Forest v Liverpool,"Is it fair to say Liverpool have gone a little bit flat recently? That is probably a bit harsh, because they only lost narrowly toTottenhamin the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, and they still should have beatenManchester Unitedin their last league game despite an underwhelming performance - they just were not ruthless enough. Arne Slot's side are still six points ahead ofArsenaland Forest, with a game in hand, but I think they could drop more points here too. The Forest defence has been formidable and 'The Wood Chopper' [Chris Wood] up front has been superb. The likes of Morgan Gibbs-White have really impressed me as well. Basically, this is going to be a very tight game with not many goals in it, and I am not going to back against Forest even if there are many ways where I think Liverpool might sneak a victory. You have got to earn the right to win the Premier League, and Liverpool have done brilliantly so far. When you are in a title race, there are always moments in the season where things can go against you a little bit, like they did against United, but they did not lose. This might be a period where they do stumble a bit but the teams below them are going to have to really sustain their push. That's not really happened so far because Arsenal andChelseaare both having a bit of a wobble. If Liverpool do drop more points here, those two sides really need to make the most of it.

3/17/2025,14:06,Slot understands Liverpool-Nottingham Forest rivalry,"WithNottingham Forestand Liverpool separated by six points at the top of the Premier League table, their meeting at The City Ground on Tuesday has a throwback feel to it. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the two clubs were locked in a tussle for all the major honours, with Brian Clough and Bob Paisley establishing a fierce rivalry. Arne Slot joked that his press officer had briefed him 10 minutes before his press conference, admitting he ""didn't know the exact years"" but was aware Forest had been a big force in English football for a long period of time"". It is perhaps understandable considering the Dutchman was born merely months after Forest beat Liverpool to the old First Division title back in 1978, before going on to lift back-to-back European Cups. The Liverpool manager explained how he is under no illusions of the threat this week's opponents pose now though, having recently watched backSeptember's 1-0 defeat at Anfield– Liverpool's only loss in the Premier League this season – to assess what they could do differently. He did not however miss the opportunity to point out that for as impressive as Forest have been, they have splashed the cash to be in title contention. ""Nuno is doing an incredible job,"" he said with a smile. ""But if you look at the amount of money they've spent, its not a complete surprise how well they're doing this season."" Forest were deducted four points last season for breaching profit and sustainability rules.

Meanwhile, Darwin Nunez will miss Tuesday's game through suspension but Diogo Jota ""is ready to play 90 minutes"" after a period of managing minutes. Slot said Wataru Endo, who came on as centre-back againstTottenham, ""is a very important player in the team"" and ""always gives everything he has."" On the academy players who have featured in cup competitions: ""It is very important for every club but especially this club. This club has always brought talent through the ranks and it is nice to see a few having an impact in training sessions and in games. It gives a good energy in the training ground and team when they are doing well."" Slot said ""it is going to be a very difficult challenge"" to get a result against Nottingham Forest as they are ""definitely"" capable of competing for the Premier League title. On the reverse fixture, Liverpool's only home defeat of the season: ""To lose on that day was hard to take. Now, looking back and seeing where they are in the league, it is not such a shock result as it felt then. They had a good game plan and made us play a poor game. We have to do better. We have to look into the details."" He said he expects ""the atmosphere to be fired up from the start,"" so they will have to be switched on from the whistle to avoid giving the home crowd being any more vocal.

3/17/2025,07:59,Liverpool 4-0 Accrington - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts afterSaturday's FA Cup gamebetween Liverpool and Accrington Stanley. Here are some of your comments: Paul:Great to see some of the young boys get a break in the first team. I so wanted Nunez to score, but absolutely delighted for Federico Chiesa - may this be the first of many in Liverpool red. Ian:Not a bad game. Liverpool rarely got into second gear. It was nice to see the youngsters having a run out and Chiesa looked lively. Darwin Nunez was disappointing again with one assist and a glaring chance hoofed over the bar, and Diogo Jota didn't do much either - he looked tired. Sean:I thought Wataru Endo was our best player by far, especially when you consider he was playing centre-half instead of in midfield. Jason:A solid, routine home win. More minutes for Jota, Harvey Elliott and Connor Bradley to sweep away comeback cobwebs. Result was never in doubt after Trent Alexander-Arnold's piledriver. I'm a big Chiesa fan - he showed his silky skills and proved his fitness. Not a starter yet, but certainly a high-impact sub at the very least. Massive credit to Accrington for a highly entertaining second half. They deserved a consolation goal, but I'm glad we kept a clean sheet. Finally, a special shoutout to Rio Ngumoha for his senior debut. Edem:That was some performance. Chiesa and youngsters like Jayden Danns need more game time. I don't see why Nunez gets to play - he needs to leave the club, probably on loan. This video can not be played "
3/17/2025,18:59,Liverpool cannot take Plymouth Argyle lightly,"Lucas Leiva's goal proved to be decisive as Liverpool beat Plymouth Argyle 1-0 in a replay eight years ago It is a dream tie in the FA Cup for Plymouth Argyle as Premier League leaders Liverpool are set to come to town next month. The Pilgrims will be hoping they can go one better than the last time these two sides met in the third round eight years ago. At AnfieldArgyle held a young Liverpool side to a 0-0 drawas 9,000 members of the Green Army made the 293-mile trip to Merseyside. It took one of the rarest of footballing feats - a Luca Leiva header - toseparate the sides 1-0 in the replayat Home Park as Divock Origi had a penalty saved by Luke McCormick as the then-League Two side frustrated Jurgen Klopp's team. Fast forward to 2025 and Argyle are bottom of the Championship and have just seen Wayne Rooney - hero of Liverpool's arch rivals Everton and Manchester United -leave his role as head coach. It will be a first taste of FA Cup football forhis replacement Miron Muslicand a first-ever away FA Cup tie for Klopp's successor Arne Slot. Argyle may well be struggling in the league and have won just five times at Home Park in all competitions this season, but their tails will be up. They upset Premier League opposition in the last round when they beat Brentford 1-0 and the squad will be keen to impress their new head coach. Liverpool cannot afford to take the Pilgrims lightly in their quest to win trophies on four fronts."

3/17/2025,14:53,Liverpool 4-0 Accrington: Chiesa off mark as Ngumoha makes history,"It may have come against League Two opposition, but Liverpool's victory over Accrington Stanley will have been a highly satisfactory one for Reds boss Arne Slot - for a number of reasons. The Dutchman fielded a strong team which subjected their opponents to relentless pressure in the first half and eventually took a deserved lead through Diogo Jota just before the half-hour mark. Trent Alexander-Arnold, who has been linked with a move to Real Madrid and was criticised by some fans following last weekend's 2-2 draw at home to Manchester United, silenced those critics with a tremendous strike into the top corner on the stroke of half-time. Rio Ngumoha, the youngest player to start a match for Liverpool at just 16 years and 135 days old, was a lively presence down the Reds' left and received a warm ovation from the Anfield crowd after being replaced by fellow teenager Jayden Danns - scorer of the hosts' third. But it was Federico Chiesa who had the final say, capping an energetic display with his first goal for the club late on. The summer signing from Juventus has endured an injury-hit campaign so far but will hope Saturday's goal marks the start of a career revival. Have your say on Liverpool's performance here"
3/17/2025,14:41,'A good first step for Chiesa',"Arne Slot spoke to ITV after Liverpool's victory against Accrington Stanley:""Credit to them, I think they showed their style of play, which is a big compliment. ""They played the same style as they always play. In the end, of course, the difference in quality makes a big difference for us, but compliments to them with how they showed up today."" On Rio Ngumoha:""He did well. There were a few moments where the fans could see why we think he's a talent. He is good in one-v-one situations. ""He showed a bit more in the first half than in the second half. It is nice to get your debut and get the win. It is a special day for him."" On Trent Alexander-Arnold's performance:""Trent didn't have his best game against Man Utd, but for the rest of the season he has been so good for us - I liked his performance today. ""Our fans have always given him a lot of support. He didn't play well, but fans reacted to that. ""If Trent just plays what we expect from him, then he gets support."" On Federico Chiesa's first goal for Liverpool:""It is definitely a good first step, but as much as I liked the way Accrington Stanley played we have to take into consideration that we're talking about League Two level. ""It is good to have him back on the pitch. He was a threat, but let's not get carried away."""

""It's a special occasion for every team we face, but especially for a lower-league team,"" said Slot when he spoke to the media at the club's snowy training ground on Friday. ""They will be all up for it. They've lived towards this game for weeks probably. ""If you go to a Champions League final, everybody is hyped up and ready and, for them, it is going to feel as if it is a Champions League final, so we have to be aware of that. ""Nine out of 10 times, the first 25 minutes or half hour is the most difficult part of the game because they will still be very intense.

3/17/2025,16:47,'I don't see the pattern if it is about Trent',Liverpool manager Arne Slot says he recognises patterns in the goals his side concede - but they are not down to right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold. This video can not be played 
3/17/2025,16:47,The stats behind Alexander-Arnold scrutiny,"Trent Alexander-Arnold has won it all with his boyhood club Liverpool, but he is out of contract in the summer and reports linking him with a potential free transfer to Real Madrid have made him a big talking point. Yet the focus on Alexander-Arnold's performances is not wholly linked to his ongoing contract situation, but rather Liverpool's defensive stats. The 26-year-old has started 17 of Liverpool's 19 Premier League games so far this season. The England full-back's role on the right of the Liverpool defence has come under scrutiny because of the number of touches and chances opponents have been getting this season when attacking down that side. According to Opta, Liverpool's opponents are having 44.1% of their touches in the left-third in the attacking areas - Liverpool's right-hand side - which is the highest ratio in the Premier League. Meanwhile, 35.7% of opposition chances against Liverpool are created on that side - the fifth-highest ratio in the division. Head coach Arne Slot defended his player in Friday's news conference and said: ""I do see a certain pattern in the goals we concede, but I don't see the pattern if it is about Trent. Not at all. ""Trent has had one difficult game for us [in Sunday's 2-2 draw withManchester Unitedat Anfield] and maybe a few that were OK to good. ""Mainly he has had great games when he played for us this season. ""I know there is a lot of focus on him at the moment, but I would also like to highlight the focus on how well he did when he came on in the last half hour [againstTottenhamon Wednesday]."" Alexander-Arnold came off the bench for Conor Bradley at Spurs, but it is not unusual for him to not start a Carabao Cup game, given Slot has consistently tried to rotate his squad in that competition."
3/17/2025,09:46,"Slot on Szoboszlai, Elliott and Accrington Stanley","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Saturday's FA Cup game against Accrington Stanley (kick-off 12:15 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai trained with Liverpool Under-21s on Thursday after recovering from illness while Jarell Quansah is also expected to be available for Saturday. On the need to rotate his squad: ""One of the most important things is to give players a rest when possible. We are not tired, not at all. We are stepping up."" However, he will only decide his squad after training today as those that travelled toTottenhamon Wednesday did not train on Thursday due to their flight being diverted to Birmingham. On the past two performances againstManchester Unitedand Spurs: ""I don't see many differences from the other games. We have won a lot of games, maybe all games we've deserved to win exceptChelsea, but never by a big margin."" He therefore wants his side to be more clinical and ruthless in their performances: ""Improving is increasing that margin, otherwise you defend on a bit of luck or a certain decision. We must make sure we don't depend on those moments anymore."" Slot said he has ""no comments"" on the ongoing transfer rumours around his players and ""99 out of 100 times in the window it has been clear that almost all of these stories aren't true."" On ""talented"" Harvey Elliott, who has been linked with a move away this month: ""It is not so easy to come back and be at your best immediately."" Slot said he is trying to ""find the balance between playing time to get them back to his best"" and setting his team up to win games. In response to questions about the Reds facing more attacks down the right side of their defence: ""I see patterns in the goals we concede but it is not about Trent [Alexander-Arnold], if that is what you mean? I know there is focus on him at the moment, but I highlight how well he did in the last half hour [against Tottenham]."" Meanwhile, youngsters Trey Nyoni and Rio Ngumoha ""are doing really well"", with Slot adding: ""As long as they keep doing that then their chances of first-team involvement will increase."" He said he ""will dive"" into studying Accrington Stanley more today but joked that he knows about the milk advert and that ""people from this area also play for the club"". Accrington ""will be up for it"" says Slot and ""we have to be ready for them to play the best games of their lives.""

3/17/2025,08:44,Liverpool aim to get back on track in FA Cup,"It is not often Arne Slot has been in this position as Liverpool boss. Following his side being beaten 1-0 atTottenhamon Wednesday in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, the Dutchman tasted defeat for only the second time in a competitive game in charge of the Reds. That's some going in his first 29 matches but, coming after being held 2-2 by a strugglingManchester Unitedat Anfield in the league on Sunday, are Liverpool showing signs of vulnerability? The Reds have let in 10 goals in their past seven games, having only let in 15 in their previous 22 outings. They also failed to score for the first time since this season's only other loss, which was a 1-0 home defeat byNottingham Foreston 14 September. Taking that into account, is there the sniff of Liverpool being on the wrong end of an FA Cup third-round upset on Saturday when they host Accrington Stanley (12:15 GMT)? The League Two side will hope so whereas Slot will be keen for his side to put on an emphatic display to get back on track after his side faced some travel disruption on the way back from London following the Spurs game. Liverpool's flight was diverted to Birmingham before they made their way back via alternative transport, with training on Thursday being cancelled as a result. We'll hear from Slot on Friday morning to get his thoughts on his first FA Cup game, how much he will rotate his squad and any injury concerns."

Bergvall fired home in the 86th minute to give Spurs a 1-0 victory in Wednesday's first leg, just moments after he made a challenge on Kostas Tsimikas which could have resulted in a second yellow card. Van Dijk was visibly irritated by the decision but played down suggestions the Reds would use that as fuel before the second leg at Anfield on 6 February. ""The frustration was purely on the pitch,"" the 33-year-old said. ""After the game you can't do anything about it any more and unfortunately for us, it ended up with him scoring the winner. ""It doesn't work like that. We don't need that motivation. We know we will be 1-0 down when the game is played at Anfield so we have to fight.

Here are some of your comments: Tottenham fans Jack:Bergvall, Gray, Spence, Kinsky - wow! Liverpool were not at the races last night but with some injuries back in the second leg, could we do it? Rajinder:Well done Ange! The lads really turned up today and executed the manager's plan beautifully. Best wishes to Bentancur for a speedy recovery. Now let's go finish the job at Anfield. Colin:Great performance from a young team who didn't let the occasion get to them. A more reserved performance with outstanding contributions from Spence, Bergvall and Solanke. It's another month before we play Liverpool again so some time to boost the ranks with new players and returns from injury. Wembley might not be that far away! John:For the first time in months, I was watching a proper Spurs team.  I can tell you, it was a great source of relief.  Well done lads and thanks. Liverpool fans Jason:Liverpool are experiencing a blip right now. Consistency is missing and a clean sheet is extinct. Opponents have figured out how to neutralize Slot-ball, with Manchester United showing the way last Sunday. I fear the second half of this season will mirror last season. We may run out of steam and end up as bridesmaid for the biggest prizes again. I truly hope I'm wrong. Raj:The controversy over the second yellow shouldn't hide from the disappointment of a poor Liverpool display. Several key players seem to be off form at the moment. Andrew:You can't win them all. Home leg should be fine. J Gibney:Looks like it's our turn for a dip in form. Fortunately the cup games will help us get back to a good level but it begins with the players being able to find their feet again, start there, keep the ball, confidence will return with it."

On the referee's performance and whether Lucas Bergvall should have had a second yellow card:""The decision he made had a lot of impact on the result tonight. There's not a lot I can say from that. ""The fourth official told me why he thought it wasn't a second yellow and he heard that probably from the referee. What we can say about it is that he said he didn't stop the counter attack, every manager would say they prefer the second yellow than a counter attack that goes on. ""It is what it is, we hate to lose but the positive is that it is better to lose when there is a second leg."" Slot revealed Jarrell Quansah came off in the fixture through illness rather than injury and adding more on the defeat, the Dutch boss said:""It was a game where both teams wanted to press the other high, both wanted to bring the ball out from the back. I liked this performance from us a bit more than the one on Sunday but it is a completely different game. ""I do agree that we played one of the best, probably the best games, two weeks ago against Tottenham. ""This performance today was definitely good enough to get a result.

Here are some of your replies: Ian:The ridiculous contract demands by Mohamed Salah. He apparently wants a three-year deal at £400,000 a week. I would offer him a two-year contract on the same wages - and if he doesn't agree then we should sell him this month. Ruairi:How good Alexis Mac Allister is. He has been consistently brilliant in every game for Liverpool. He creates many chances and is rarely mentioned. An average goalkeeper atAston Villa,who was in the same World Cup-winning side, is praised a lot, but Mac Allister has been the most important cog in Arne Slot's Liverpool side. Alex:January is arguably our biggest test yet. We play across four competitions and have some incredibly tough fixtures - away games atTottenham,Nottingham Forest,Brentford,PSV Eindhoven andBournemouth,albeit that one is on 1 February. This month could really have a defining impact on our entire season. Joshua:Liverpool's chances of winning a quadruple this season. Loz:The seeming reduction in injuries under Slot. Has this been caused by having a different approach? Has our success partly come through the consistency of a reasonably stable structure? Christian:The lack of minutes for Federico Chiesa. At times, he has had mystery absences that have not been explained. At other times, Slot mentions his lack of pre-season training, but we are now halfway through the season. How long does he need? Salah is a machine but he cannot play every minute of a season that may run close to 60 games. Why is Chiesa not being deployed? You can't get match fit without playing."

3/17/2025,18:05,'I do wonder at what point the contract situation will shift',"New York Times chief football correspondent Rory Smith agrees with Liverpool head coach Arne Slot that Trent Alexander-Arnold's poor performance againstManchester Unitedwas nothing to do with the Real Madrid transfer rumours. ""Correlation isn't causation,"" said Smith on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club. ""I would be very surprised if the first time Alexander-Arnold had heard about Real Madrid's interest in signing him was last week. That would suggest he is not engaging with the world as he should be. ""I can understand why people have put it all together because he didn't play well on Sunday and there had been all the talk of Real's enquiry and it being rejected. But I don't think there is any reason why that would have affected him more against United than during the rest of the season. ""His contract has not just become unsigned. It has been dragging on so it seems too convenient to single out that game. ""But I do think there could become a time where it will become a problem for Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk. It's very obvious that it is not good planning from Liverpool that three of their best players are out of contract at one time - and because they are all linked. ""Salah is the highest earner, so if you agree a contract at X amount, that could mean Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold ask for Y and Z. ""I do wonder at what point the situation will shift. So far, all of the emphasis has been on the club, but it has to be handled carefully."" Watch the full episode of Monday Night Club on BBC iPlayerorlisten on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,16:27,"'Sell him', 'keep him' or 'let the manager decide'? Fans on Alexander-Arnold","With speculation around Trent Alexander-Arnold's Liverpool future continuing to rumble on, we asked for your views on how the club should handle the delicate situation. Here are some of your comments: Steven:Let the manager decide. One bad match does not make him terrible but this has the potential to become a distraction. It is clear he wants to go, so do it now. Fraser:Keep him. As much as I was bitterly disappointed with his performance on Sunday, we should try to keep him as much as possible (including the summer). He is still a great player and has a lot to prove. However, if he keeps on playing like he did on Sunday and puts in no effort, he should not act surprised if he finds Conor Bradley or Joe Gomez (when he returns from injury) starting ahead of him in some games. Neil:Let him go. He's not a full-back - he can't defend and teams know that. Both ofManchester United'sgoals on Sunday came down his side. Bradley, Andy Robertson and Kostas Tsimikas are as good going forward as Trent - but they can also defend. Mike:We are stronger for having him in the team. Anyone can have a bad game so try not to overreact. He could help this situation by either signing a new contract or coming out and saying he wants to try somewhere new. It would be far better to just be honest. If he is to leave, say so and then concentrate on winning a Premier League title. The best way to leave. David:Sell him now. If he cannot make up his mind by now after all the years he has been with us it is time to move on and give us a chance to regroup. We need to accept he is looking elsewhere. Phil:Too good to lose for nothing, but a bit of loyalty wouldn't go amiss. How much do you need?"
3/17/2025,15:35,'Teams must do a fine balancing act against Liverpool',"BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty has been answering your questions on all things Premier League. Seamus asked:I can't help but feel that Liverpool are always playing on the edge of draws and wins by the sheer strength of their attack. If they get ahead they usually win. But their defence is shaky at best, if pressed. On Sunday, they were exposed for speed and were pressed. Do you feel they would be in as good a position now if other teams attacked them likeManchester Uniteddid? Phil answered:OnlyArsenalhave a better defensive record in the Premier League than Liverpool, who have conceded 19 goals in 19 games, so there are not too many faults to pick at. I do take your point, though, that Liverpool have looked a little vulnerable defensively on occasions this season. When teams play against Liverpool, they have to achieve a fine balancing act between defensive solidity and ambition going forward because Arne Slot's side hold so many attacking cards in players like Mohamed Salah, Luis Diaz, Cody Gakpo and Diogo Jota. Over-commitment is a very dangerous game for anyone playing Liverpool. The one team who got it absolutely spot on this season was Nuno Espirito Santo'sNottingham Forest,who won at Anfield in what is still Liverpool's only league defeat of the campaign."

Here are the key lines from his news conference: Defender Joe Gomez ""is injured and will be back in a few weeks"" but otherwise there are no new injury concerns. Midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai did not train on Monday. Slot is hopeful he will on Tuesday but he remains a doubt. He said ""the best line-up might be ones who don't start a lot"" when asked about the possibility of squad rotation. On whether Caoimhin Kelleher will return in goal as he has done in previous cup ties: ""I have decided the whole line-up already. You will find out tomorrow what arguments there are and I will be more than happy to answer those questions before or after the game."" Slot said he spoke to Trent Alexander-Arnold after theManchester Unitedgame, as he does with everyone else, and ""showed him where to improve"". On the criticism of Alexander-Arnold's performance: ""We were all disappointed by the way we played and the result - not just Trent. Parts of our game we weren't completely happy with. It wasn't only Trent - there were more things we could have done better."" He said all of his players know they can speak to him and ""if there's anything worrying them, they share it"". Slot went on to say that he is ""not focused on social media posts or what people are saying"", adding: ""If you do that as Liverpool manager you will have no life because people are always talking about us."" He said ""the team is in a good place"" but the club ""always look at the market"" to see if they can further strengthen the squad and this January is no different. On Spurs: ""What we expect is two teams with a clear identity. That's what most people expect to see. Both teams trying to force it on the other. Large parts of the game two weeks ago we could show our identity, but they showed how good a team they are."" Follow all of Tuesday's news conferences and the rest of the day's football news"
3/17/2025,10:52,'Why can't more Premier League games be like this?',"Trudging through the freezing snow and slush into Anfield on Sunday, I considered whether it would be a Manchester United mauling or possibly the dull, damp, drab disappointment that this fixture has sometimes served up. I didn't even consider the possibility of a Premier League classic with the ever-growing excitement of a win or lose cup tie, laced with drama that just grew until the final whistle in front of a raucous and hugely vocal set of fans from both sides. There were narratives enough to fill an airport page turner. The stories of Slot v Amorin and their varying tactics. I was asking the most obvious question of all long before the last two goals were scored - 'can United show this passion every week and if they can, will they manage European football this season rather than fight against relegation for the rest of the campaign?' Where did Diogo Dalot's dashing performance come from and was it at least partly down to Trent Alexander-Arnold's paucity on the day? Would Darwin Nunez have been sent off for that 'challenge' anywhere else other than in front of The Kop? I could go on but the thought in my head above all others was, why can't more Premier League games be like this? Having watched far too many games whose defining feature is dozens of passes between the goalkeeper and his defenders before any progress is finally attempted to get up the field, I am getting royally bored with this chin stroking style. It was great when Barcelona did it in their hey day, but that was because you had Xavi, Iniesta and Messi who would then do something beautiful and creative up front. This tiresome overplaying is fast becoming obsolete, even if some coaches and indeed their army of advisors who are over-coaching creatives, haven't figured it out yet. This fascinating, fast-paced match was more open than some coaches could countenance and it is just to underline, it isn't old school ""long-ball"" football. This was part of a reaction to an ever-more moribund style that values possession stats, passing stats and any stats over and above the real reason that football exists and is loved by all us, entertainment. Well at least I hope this is the case. Sign up to read more from Pat Nevin in his Football Extra newsletter"
3/17/2025,10:48,Should Reds eye Robertson replacement?,"BBC Chief football writer Phil McNulty has been answering your questions on all things Premier League. Jim asked:Hi Phil, always enjoy reading your articles on BBC Sport. With all the fuss about the bad game Trent Alexander-Arnold had, is it being overlooked a little that on the other flank, Andy Robertson has really dropped off in recent months? Is it time for Liverpool to splash out on a new left back and if so, who? Phil answered:I do think we need to be careful not to go into a knee-jerk about Trent Alexander-Arnold's poor game on Sunday but there is no doubt the timing was not great after Real Madrid officially declared their interest. He was so far off the pace and careless, and was clearly exploited by Manchester United, who launched 54% of their attacks down his right flank. His stray pass led to Lisandro Martinez's first goal for United and Amad Diallo's equaliser also came down his flank. Unfortunately for him and Liverpool, this will become an issue and a talking point as long as his future remains unclear. He can put it right quickly with good performances, but for the first time yesterday, I heard the noises of frustration from Liverpool fans towards him - not a huge number but enough to make themselves heard. Liverpool do not need this to escalate when they have such a great chance of making this a wonderful season under Arne Slot. Meanwhile, I agree about Andy Robertson. He has not been at his best this season and, while still a fine full-back, Liverpool will soon have to start looking to the future. Wolves and Bournemouth fans won't like this, but Rayan Ait-Nouri and Milos Kerkez are two players I can see them looking at. Sorry Wolves and Cherries."
3/17/2025,08:23,'Only human' for Alexander-Arnold to be affected - Aldridge,"It was ""obvious"" Trent Alexander-Arnold was ""not in the right frame of mind"" againstManchester United, says former Liverpool striker John Aldridge. Reds right-back Alexander-Arnold struggled to cope in the 2-2 draw at Anfield on Sunday. The 26-year-old was subject to strong criticism from pundits and supporters for his performance, with many questioning if he had been distracted by talk over his future and a reported offer from Real Madrid. ""You ask every player who has played football and you get certain days that your head's not right,"" Aldridge told BBC World Service's Sport Today programme. ""I've been there. I've played in games, especially early on in my career, when I think 'please bring me off, I don't know what's wrong with me, it's like I've got my boots on the wrong way around'. ""I think the hype around Trent [Alexander-Arnold] the last week, since 1 January in particular with Real Madrid and so forth, it's going to affect him, absolutely. ""You've got to give Manchester United credit for the way they went about it. They overloaded him with the two best players - Bruno Fernandes and [Diogo] Dalot. ""They hardly went down our left-hand side, they capitalised on it and put a lot of pressure on Trent. It's hard for anyone to deal with it, especially when you're not in the right frame of mind as Trent wasn't, that was obvious. ""It is only human. It [transfer rumours] is naturally going to affect him, and it did, it took its toll on the lad. People talking about [how] he can't defend - of course he can defend.

3/17/2025,19:13,Was Alexander-Arnold scrutiny against Man Utd warranted?,"""Wasn't his best game"" and ""schoolboy stuff"". After Sunday's game againstManchester United, Liverpool boss Arne Slot admitted right-back Trent Alexander-Arnoldwas not at his best, while former midfielder turned pundit Roy Keane lamented the defender's display. But was Alexander-Arnold's performancereally that bad? It depends where you look. After reports surfaced during the week thatReal Madrid had approached Liverpool about the 26-year-old, who is out of contract at the end of the season, there was always going to be more focus on him during this game. With nearly 55% of United's attack coming down Liverpool's right according to Opta, it was clear Ruben Amorim's side were targeting any potential vulnerability - and the creativity of Bruno Fernandes and of Diogo Dalot took full advantage. But this is not the first time Alexander-Arnold's defensive capabilities have been questioned and, even this season, he has statistically had worse games. Against the Red Devils, the England international lost possession 27 times - the second-most of a Liverpool player in the Premier League this season, but still fewer times than he gave the ball away in their defeat byNottingham Forest(33) earlier this season. What would be concerning for Reds' fans, however, is the regularity in which he loses high amounts of possession during matches, with the right-back appearing seven times in the top 10 for possession lost in games by Liverpool players this campaign. Alexander-Arnold was surprisingly only dribbled past twice by opponents on Sunday, a figure  that has been topped by himself on six other occasions so far this term. But, with no tackles recorded and all five of his duels lost, his willingness and ability to get stuck into the opposition in such an intense derby game for Reds' fans will have frustrated supporters. Despite this, Alexander-Arnold won possession more times (eight), had more touches (97), made more interceptions (four) and equal the amount of passes (63) as any Liverpool player in the match. And, as shown in their heatmaps, the defender covered more of the pitch than fellow full-back Andy Robertson - although the amount of play coming down the right side from United will have had an impact. With transfer silly season only just beginning and the games only going to get tougher, the scrutiny around Alexander-Arnold looks set to intensify.

3/17/2025,16:30,"'Whether Trent is staying or going, there is still a title to be won'","I can forgive Trent Alexander-Arnold misplaced passes, the occasional poor touch or a bad decision. This happens to footballers. What is simply unacceptable, however, is the manner in which he 'defended' againstManchester Unitedon Sunday. Trent looked like he was completely uninterested in tracking Lisandro Martinez for their opener, made worse by the fact he had just passed United the ball in the first place. He won zero duels in 86 minutes. Conor Bradley came on and won one in his first minute. Trent is a sensational footballer - the most talented and creative right-back I have ever seen. But on Sunday he looked every bit a player who had been extremely affected by the consistent Real Madrid speculation. His head was not in the game. Trent has been world-class this term under Arne Slot, but this was horrific. Reports suggest Liverpool have offered Trent big money,but the Real Madrid friendly publications think Alexander-Arnold already has one foot in Spain. Sadly, the performance against United hinted at the latter. Even more worryingly, a small number of fans inside the ground let Trent know what they thought of his effort, which has never happened before. He needs to get his head right if he is to play in the first leg of the Carabao Cup semi-final atTottenhamon Wednesday, but the important fixtures are againstNottingham ForestandBrentfordin the Premier League.

3/17/2025,16:04,Was Alexander-Arnold's head 'elsewhere'?,"Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold ""looked like his head could have been elsewhere"" againstManchester United, says formerBrightonstriker Glenn Murray. The England international struggled to deal with United wing-back Diogo Dalot for the majority of the game and left the Reds exposed down their right flank. Was it just a bad day at the office? Or is it reflective of his contract situation and the rumours of a move to Real Madrid? ""It would be fair to say defending has never been his strong point,"" said Murray on BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. ""But what he can give Liverpool going forward is better than going the other way. ""A stat popped up during the game and it said 60% of Manchester United's attacks had come down his side. ""We are in January, he is a free agent and clubs are allowed to contact him. Who knows what has arrived in the inbox.

3/17/2025,15:30,'The three away games are the defining moment in Liverpool's season',"It was ""two points dropped"" for Liverpool againstManchester United, but upcoming away games will be the ""defining moment"" of their season, says The Anfield Wrap's Neil Atkinson. Given the form of both sides, many fans and pundits were expecting a rout for the Reds against rivals United at Anfield on Sunday. However, Ruben Amorim's team put in arguably their best performance of the season to come away with a 2-2 draw. The result means Liverpool remain top of the Premier League table, clear ofArsenalby six points and with a game in hand. ""Manchester United is still a difficult game. The manager is not an idiot and the football players have got a lot of professional pride,"" Atkinson told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. ""It is two points dropped from a Liverpool perspective with it being a home game against a side who are mid-table - and also the fact they were 2-1 up. That is why it sticks in the craw a little bit. ""Off the back of it, we can praise Manchester United, we can praise their manager, we can praise their players - but Liverpool should still be winning that game. ""If you had offered me on Friday that we just match Arsenal's result, I would have taken that. It is a weekend where nothing has changed in the title race, so from Liverpool's point of view they can take some solace in that. ""Liverpool have got three difficult away games on the horizon.

3/17/2025,13:38,Palace track Liverpool loanee Doak in search for January reinforcements,"Crystal Palace are interested in Liverpool forward Ben Doak, who is on loan at Middlesbrough in the Championship as they look for January reinforcements. The Eagles are looking to add a left wing-back and an attacker to their squad to increase the options manager Oliver Glasner has for the second half of the season. Doak has two goals and six assists in 21 appearances for Middlesbrough so far this season. Liverpool have had offers for Doak with clubs in the Premier League and across Europe showing interest in the Scotland winger. Palace have had a £15m bid rejected, according to reports. However, the bids so far for 19-year-old do not come close to what the Reds are looking for, with the Anfield club valuing him at about £30m. Doak has helped Boro to fifth place in the Championship and are happy with how his stint at the Riverside club is going. They believe he has the quality to return and play for them in the future. The Eagles have also been linked with Jobe Bellingham ofSunderlandand RC Lens midfielder Andy Diouf, but one source has said a move for either midfielder is unlikely this month. Elsewhere,Chelseado have a recall option on Trevoh Chalobah, who is on loan at Selhurst Park but Glasner is ""planning"" for him to stay.

3/17/2025,11:06,Alexander-Arnold feels first signs of Anfield frustration,"Trent Alexander-Arnold's Liverpool future - along with Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk - has provided a permanent subplot to Liverpool's stellar first season under head coach Arne Slot. All has been serene as Liverpool have dominated in the Premier League, contract negotiations a major talking point but not a distraction to winning games until Sunday's 2-2 draw withManchester Unitedat Anfield. Even before kick-off, a new banner appeared on the Kop reading ""Give Mo And Co Their Dough"", with Alexander-Arnold and Van Dijk's images emblazoned alongside Salah. And yet, in the past few days, the first signs of frustration with Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool supporters have appeared as it emerged Real Madrid have made an official bid to take the 26-year-old in January. Bad timing, perhaps, but this was followed by Alexander-Arnold delivering a nightmare performance as Liverpool were held to a deserved 2-2 draw by previously struggling United. Alexander-Arnold's display was too casual throughout, a stray pass the catalyst for Lisandro Martinez's opener for United, with coach Ruben Amorim also clearly devising a strategy to target Alexander-Arnold on the right flank, where the majority of their attacks came. Alexander-Arnold sloppily played Rasmus Hojlund onside for a first-half chance that was rescued by Alisson's save, while Amad Diallo's equaliser came after Alejandro Garnacho exploited more space on the right flank. It may have been an optical illusion, but Alexander-Arnold looked distracted and lacklustre throughout, a glaring weakness defensively and shorn of his usual attacking threat. Slot jumped to Alexander-Arnold's defence, but this was still one of the defender's poorest performances in recent memory, all under the gaze of new head coach Thomas Tuchel. And, for the first time, there were the noises of frustration and discontent from Liverpool fans inside Anfield aimed at the local boy they call ""the scouser in our team"" - not helped by United defying the odds to take an unexpected point. There should be no knee-jerking over one bad display among many top-class this season, but the timing - coming at the start of January and after Real stepped up their interest - could not have been worse for Alexander-Arnold. He has plenty of time to apply the correction, but any more displays like this and frustration will rise, along with the speculation that his head is being turned as Real lurk in the shadows with their interest now out in the open. Liverpool do not need any untimely backdrops with their season going so well - and that will be helped by Alexander-Arnold returning to his best as quickly as possible."
3/17/2025,08:32,Liverpool 2-2 Man Utd - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts after Sunday's Premier League game between Liverpool and Manchester United. Here are some of your comments: Alison:I never blame one player, but this game I do. Trent Alexander-Arnold cost us the game. The other defenders were in disarray because of him. Si:So disappointed by Trent. His head was not in the game. He is a local lad, and he has been a great player, but his heart isn't in it. Maybe he should leave. I'm still wondering why Darwin Nunez is still getting a chance? He has no natural goalscoring ability. Richard:Trent has got to put this contract saga to bed - and soon. Some people might say that his head was on the plane to Madrid here, but I personally think he will stay. But sign ASAP please, Trent! Ishtaq:Trent, you can go. One Hollywood pass every three games does not get you £300,000 a week. Conor Bradley was better in the few minutes he came on for. Gareth:Overall a poor performance and way off our usual standards so, with that being said, it is a good point. A lot of the players just weren't at the races. Virgil van Dijk, Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo were probably the only three who played anywhere near their usual levels. But after the emotion of the game has settled, this result, while not what we wanted, isn't that bad. Shay:The result was a fair reflection of the game. Liverpool were poor and United were dogged. My worry is that Liverpool are over reliant on Mohamed Salah for creativity and someone in midfield needs to step up. They also keep conceding first, meaning that we need to sap energy for comebacks. This happened last season as well and we saw how that ended. A penny for Arne Slot's thoughts.Nottingham Forestaway next - this could be the blip in form thatArsenalneeded. Jamie:Liverpool were well below their recent standards. We missed Dominik Szoboszlai's pressing and work-rate. Mac Allister was the only real standout performer in the first half. We got better once we equalised, but we still looked shaky and our passing was off and nervy."

Slot has also been speaking to Match of the Day about whether his side underestimated Manchester United:""No, I don't think that has anything to do with it. It's just them going into a low block playing here. ""They have quality with the ball and without the ball. They are difficult to play through. It was so open when they started to play. You can see more how good they are if they are trying to play. ""For the first 75 minutes, [Andre] Onana played the ball long and every free-kick they got, they just hit it forward.

I'm definitely disappointed with dropping points at home, but it is what is and we have to move on and we will. ""We found the 2-1 and then it is about trying to manage the game and keep the ball for longer than three and four passes. We lost the ball too easily at times and then we were more open than we should have been. ""We are not perfect, we are still learning and we have to learn from this as well."" On whether they came into the game underestimating Manchester United:""That's all the media - media talk. It's nothing to do with us. We prepared for a very tough game like we have seen today. We didn't think any of that."" On being in a strong position when you look at the league table:""We look at the next game, we don't look at the league table."""

Having only fallen behind in four of their first 13 league games under Arne Slot, the Reds have since trailed in four of their last six games.

3/17/2025,09:09,Sutton's predictions: Liverpool v Man Utd,"Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests. For week 20, he takes on The Zutons frontman Dave McCabe, who supports Liverpool. Sutton's prediction: 5-0 The historic rivalry between these two clubs is intense but, on the pitch, the contest is not even close at the moment. Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is talking about being in a relegation battle and you can see why. His side were torn apart in the first 30 minutes byNewcastleat Old Trafford on Monday, and why would anything be different at Anfield? Whoever Liverpool pick, they have got goals in their team and United have no chance of keeping them out. The scoreline won't hit double figures but anything else is possible - and that is me being nice to United. Liverpool should demolish them, and they will demolish them - it is just a question of how many goals they get. United will play for pride, play for the badge and for the jersey, and all of that, but it won't make any difference. Liverpool are in a different stratosphere at the moment and I feel sorry for Amorim because this is going to be another painful afternoon for him. McCabe's prediction: 3-2 I think United are going to turn up and this is going to be closer than most people think. I just spoke to our [band's] manager, who is a United fan, and he said it would be 2-0 to Liverpool - but I just have a feeling they will make a game of it. United are that bad at the moment, we could take our eye off the ball against them and that is when they will start playing, so we have to be careful and make sure we put them away. Read the full predictions and have your say here"
3/17/2025,11:46,Salah's favourite fixture? The stats are against United,"Manchester United are going to have to overturn recent history if they are to get something against Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. The stats are pretty damning - only one goal in their past eight visits, and no goals in their past five. Jesse Lingard was the last player to score for United at Anfield - in 2018! Mohamed Salah, on the other hand, seems to love this fixture more than anybody else Since 2020, the Liverpool forward has netted against United 12 times in the Premier League - more than any other player. He tops the stats for assists against United too, with six in the top flight."
3/17/2025,19:58,'It's my last year in the club' - Salah,"Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah saysthere is ""no progress""in talks to extend his contract with the club. The 32-year-old has entered the final six months of his deal and can now hold talks with non-English clubs over a free transfer when it expires this summer. Salah has scored 20 goals this season to help the Reds top the Premier League and Champions League tables, but the 32-year-old has been increasingly vocal about his future in recent media interviews. Asked whether he thought this was his final season at Anfield, he toldSky Sports, external: ""So far, yes. It's the last six months. ""There is no progress there. We are far away from any progress. So, we just need to wait and see."" Asked about the prospect of winning the Premier League this season, he added: ""It's my last year in the club so you want to do something special for the city."" After a win overSouthamptonin November, Salah saidhe was ""disappointed"" by the lack of a contract offer, reiterating after Monday's win atWest Hamthat anyagreement was ""far away"". Despite this, the formerChelseaforward has insisted he is able to block out the speculation and focus on his football. He said: ""The thing in my head is that if this is the last six months, what do you want to see in the future? ""Do you want to look back and say I was concerned or stressed about the contract? Or do you just want to say I had an unbelievable season? That's what is in my head. ""If I ever feel distraction, I just remind myself I want to look back and say I had an unbelievable season. That's what I want to do."""
3/17/2025,19:02,Slot 'defused' Alexander-Arnold questions in 'classic fashion',"Arne Slot has proved in his first season at Liverpool that he is pretty adept at navigating his way round tricky topics and Friday morning was no different. After BBC sources confirmed that Real Madrid have made an approach - but no offer - about signing Trent Alexander-Arnold this month, there was a feeling of anticipation in the news conference room at the Reds' training ground as to whether Slot would shed any more light on the situation. We have all got used to his approach to media commitments and, as expected, the Dutchman gave very little away. But in classic Slot fashion, there was just enough charm in his answers to avoid proceedings getting awkward. Asked if he could rule out a sale in January now that there are six months left on Alexander-Arnold's contract, the Liverpool boss  answered quickly that he could confirm his full-back ""would be playing on Sunday"". It came across as cold, but there was a pause and a smile as if he recognised he needed to give us more. Slot went on to praise Alexander-Arnold's performances, insisting his vice-captain is ""fully committed"" to Liverpool and has been working his backside off in training - or words to that effect! He got a laugh, defused the situation and faced no more questions about his defender - but they will keep coming all month with the transfer window open and reports from Spain continuing to gather pace."
3/17/2025,18:35,Dalglish and Ferguson's fierce rivalry 'never without respect',"Sir Kenny Dalglish says ""there was never any animosity"" between him and Sir Alex Ferguson despite their great managerial rivalry. Reflecting on playing under and against Ferguson, fellow Scotsman Dalglish told the BBC's Sporting Giants podcast about the differences between their managerial styles and why their rivalry was an ""essential part"" of football in the top flight. ""A lot of the time it was psychological to throw things out there to try and wind up,"" Dalglish said. ""Sometimes you felt like you were falling for it and other times you would not give it back. ""That was not just with Fergie, but with everybody at the time. ""There was never a time he came back with something [in the media] and I regretted it. There was never any animosity between us. As soon as the game was played, that was it and we would have a drink. ""There has always been respect from my side - but you did get great satisfaction when you beat him!"" Dalglish and Ferguson's rivalry in English football stemmed from Dalglish's time at Liverpool from 1985-1991 and his following stint at Blackburn. It was to be later re-ignited when the Reds legend returned to Anfield in 2011. The 73-year-old recalls ""the moaning at Old Trafford"" as Ferguson underwent a difficult first three years at the club. We now know that those seasons were a small price to pay for long-term success, but at the time ""there was a lot of discontent"" about the direction Ferguson was going in. The FA Cup win of 1990 brought silverware to Old Trafford and Dalglish joked: ""That was him up and running then - unfortunately!"" It was the first trophy of 38 during his time as United boss and Dalglish praised his rival's sustained success at United. ""You have to look at him and admire him,"" he said. ""I don't think I was as volatile as Fergie in the dressing room but that was a huge factor to the success that he had - the way he went around it."" Now deemed as managerial greats and Scottish legends, the pair have a strong friendship that belies their touchline antics. ""We stick to what we know best and we talk football,"" Dalglish said. ""He always comes over when I see him and we always end up together. ""There is a competition there still. There is enjoyment for winning and disappointment for losing. But it is never without respect."" Listen to the Sporting Giants podcast on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,17:53,Who will secure Champions League football?,"As we enter a new calendar year and the halfway point of the season, the Opta Supercomputer has been busy making its predictions. But who has the best chance of securing Champions League football next season? With England given a 97.8% chance of finishing in the top two of Uefa's coefficients rankings and receiving a bonus place in next season's competition, it is highly likely to be a race to finish in the top five of the Premier League this campaign. One team essentially guaranteed a Champions League spot season, according to the Supercomputer's simulations, is high-flying league leaders Liverpool (100%). Following closely on their heels are Arsenal and Chelsea, who occupy second and fourthgoing into this weekend's fixtures, with a 99.8% and 91.7% chance of finishing in the top five respectively. Despite their unprecedented drop-off in form over the past two months, Manchester City fans will be pleased to hear Opta still gives them a 89.1% chance of clinching the potential final Champions League spot next season. It then becomes a hotly fought battle between two of the most in-form teams in the league right now. Despite third-placed Nottingham Forest's incredible campaign so far, Nuno Espirito Santo's side still fall below Newcastle United in the predictions for fifth place - with a 33.6% chance compared to the Magpies' 44.6%. Four teams still have an outside chance of getting that coveted spot, with Aston Villa (13.8%), Bournemouth (9.8%), Fulham (6.2%) and Tottenham (5.4%) in the race."

3/17/2025,13:30,Alexander-Arnold situation 'feels like it is on a knife edge',"The Athletic football correspondent David Ornstein says he does not believe ""any firm decisions have been made just yet"" in the ongoing saga of Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold's potential move to Real Madrid. Ornstein told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast: ""We don't know the exact reasons for Real Madrid's approach. Perhaps they were just doing it out of courtesy so Liverpool have an option to cash in on him now as opposed to seeing him walk away for nothing in the summer of 2025. ""Real Madrid are increasingly confident, we understand, but Liverpool will keep trying to renew Trent Alexander-Arnold, so it feels like it's on a bit of a knife edge. ""It's a massive decision for him as the homegrown boy, Liverpool born and bred and such a key part of their plans. ""It would be a shock to many if he was to leave now. I think the summer is more likely but there's still a bit of time to go this month for us to have twists and turns in this situation."""
3/17/2025,13:08,Zumbimendi 'absolutely ready to move now',"Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi is only behind Rodri when it comes to the best holding midfielders in the world, according to Spanish football expert Guillem Balague. Liverpool came close to signing the 25-year-old European Championship winner in the summer but the deal never came to fruition. With 2024 Ballon d'Or winner Rodri out for the season through injury, Manchester City are also understood to have an interest in the Spain international. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Euro Leagues podcast, Balague said: ""Zumbimendi is perhaps, after Rodri, the best holding midfielder in world. That is what Liverpool decided, having gone through a lot of algorithms and numbers and knowing of his personality. Barcelona also wanted him. ""I have been told that everything was done with Liverpool, absolutely everything, and then he personally decided not to move to England. At Real Sociedad, you have to be seen to be saying 'no' at least once. But three months into the season I think he was like 'I am ready to go'. ""So when Manchester City want to look for a replacement for Rodri or someone to challenge him - I'm not sure they will do that having the first and second best in the world - but that is the guy to look for. Barcelona would like him but don't have the money, but I think he is absolutely ready to move now."" When asked why he feels Zubimendi is second to Rodri in that position, Balague replied: ""It is about your understanding of it [the game] - how you limit your weaknesses. ""He is perhaps not the strongest or the fastest but [it is about] how he reads the game, how he identifies where the pressure has to go and how he leads the team.""

3/17/2025,09:54,"Slot on injury returns, Alexander-Arnold rumours and Man Utd","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game againstManchester Unitedat Anfield (kick-off 16:30 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Ibrahima Konate and Conor Bradley will train with the squad today, with Slot saying he is ""curious and interested"" to see if they can be available for Sunday. However, Joe Gomez ""is not in a good place with his injury"" and remains sidelined ""for a few weeks,"" but otherwise there are no new injury concerns. Slot said resting players is not an option against Manchester United because Ruben Amorim's side ""have much better players than the league table shows at the moment."" Slot also said Trent Alexander-Arnold has ""made a step up this season"" in his performances but ""consistency"" is what the right-back can still improve. On the constant noise around a potential Real Madrid move for Alexander-Arnold and how such rumours affect players: ""I can tell you that he is playing on Sunday and hopefully he brings the same performance that he has done for the first half of the season. I see the way he is in training and he is fully committed to us."" Slot had high praise for Virgil van Dijk, who will mark his seven-year debut this weekend: ""He is a complete player. He is the one that leads the team from start to finish. From the moment I blow my whistle on the training ground, he is the one player that you can always hear. He brings a lot of positive energy."" On media comments about Mohamed Salah being the best player in the world: ""I think it's difficult to compare players. If I only look at my own team, Virgil also has an outstanding season but he doesn't have the numbers because he is a defender. The numbers Mo has speak for themselves. If you simply look at the numbers and the way he's playing, he's definitely a great, great player."" On his side boasting over 30 league title medals between them: ""It is always important that you have players or staff players that know how to work things.

He caught Magpies goalkeeper Steve Harper cold with a fantastic hit from all of 60.6 yards (to be exact). Harper maybe ought to have been more prepared.

3/17/2025,17:39,Is Bradley the ready-made replacement for Alexander-Arnold?,"Trent Alexander-Arnold is a world-class player, a creator and defender in equal measure, so it would be folly to suggest he would not be missed by Liverpool. If he wants a fresh challenge, it is clear Real Madrid would welcome him. It is now up to Alexander-Arnold to decide if he wants to take that challenge. The good news for Liverpool is they might just have the perfect replacement for Alexander-Arnold in their own ranks - the outstanding Northern Ireland 21-year-old Conor Bradley has all the makings of a long-term Anfield star. Ironically, it was against Real Madrid – with Alexander-Arnold watching from the bench – that Bradley delivered a magnificent display hinting at his quality in Liverpool's 2-0 Champions League win over Carlo Ancelotti's side at Anfield in November. Bradley brought Anfield to its feet, literally, with a shuddering first-half challenge on Kylian Mbappe as he approached The Kop. It left Mbappe in an undignified heap. It was fearless, perfectly legal, perfectly timed and demonstrated huge belief and confidence. If Alexander-Arnold does go, he will leave a huge hole, but Bradley has shown he has all the ability to soften such a heavy blow.

3/17/2025,16:50,How important is Alexander-Arnold to Liverpool?,"Trent Alexander-Arnold has been at Liverpool since he was six years old so any decision to leave Anfield would be a significant one for both him and the Reds. He made his breakthrough in the 2016-17 campaign and has been a mainstay of the first team ever since, regularly playing more than 40 games a season. Only Mohamed Salah (1,586) and Ryan Gravenberch (1,560) have played more minutes than Alexander-Arnold (1,317) this season, underlining how important he is to Slot. The Reds would not only miss his reliability in defence but also his contribution to their attack. No Liverpool player has created more chances than Alexander-Arnold's 36 - level with Salah. That includes four assists - second only to Salah, who has a stunning 13. Read more on Alexander-Arnold's Liverpool career"
3/17/2025,15:30,'Dynamic' Marmoush at 'a different level',"Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush is ""going to be a superstar"", says German football expert Raphael Honigstein. The 25-year-old has been linked with a move to the Premier League after an impressive first half of the campaign that has seen him score 18 goals and provide 12 assists in just 24 games. It is form not too dissimilar to that of his international team-mate Mohamed Salah, drawing understandable parallels between the two. ""A really dynamic, wide forward who can play through the middle - he is not really a winger and he is not really a centre-forward; he is in between,"" Honigstein told the BBC Euro Leagues podcast. ""Some people have compared him to his compatriot Mohamed Salah. He is perhaps not quite as tricky and explosive but his finishing is incredible. He is one of those players that came to Germany when he was 18 and for six years and you think 'OK, interesting player but probably not really going to set the world alight,' then suddenly this season he has absolutely exploded to a different level. ""It is to the point we are talking 60-70m euros, maybe 80m euros, in the transfer market. There will be a big move ahead for him and that is why he is one to watch because it is very unlikely Eintracht Frankfurt will stick with him. Some big clubs will come in for him and, if he continues on the same path, he is going to be a superstar. ""He will be a great buy for whoever gets him."" French football journalist Julien Laurens agreed, saying: ""He can probably get even better because he is still young.

Andrew:Liverpool's New Year resolution: ""We will not let players leave on free transfers."" Yusuf:I am sure all of our New Year resolutions as Liverpool fans would be to have all three of Salah, Van Dijk and Trent's contracts signed. When that is over and done with, we should look to bolster defensive options. Darren:Surely it's obvious? Get contracts sorted for those three and get a system in place to ensure things like this don't happen? Mark:Get the contracts sorted as well as signing Kerkez and cover for Gravenberch. Geoff:Strengthen, strengthen, strengthen! As injuries inevitably kick in, we need to bring a left-back and centre-back in, and get Salah and Van Dijk's contracts sorted while we are riding the wave of success. Max:Just make sure we don't have another one of our collapses again. This year I think it's different under Slot, we look more stable and I can trust we can keep going until the end of the season.

3/17/2025,11:46,Alexander-Arnold: 'Selfish' or 'understandable'?,"We asked for your views on Real Madrid's reported approach for Trent Alexander-Arnold, and Liverpool's knock back, whichJamie Carragher, externalandMichael Owen, externalhave been vocal about on X. Here are some of your comments: Sean:Trent is a big lad. He will make his own choice. I'd love him to stay. The sadness hovering over it all is that we fans fear he'll end up like Michael Owen; traded legendary status for a trip to Spain. I hope when Alexander-Arnold returns to Anfield that he gets a better reception than Owen does (he's largely ignored). The Reds wish to praise and love these lads who could be legends. Madrid is a top club and wonderful city. But it ain't Liverpool! Tommy:Out of the three players he is the one we can afford to lose. He's a luxury player who too often doesn't live up to the massive hype on him. We have a ready-made replacement, so he can go. It is getting boring now. He, like Owen, will be warming the bench at Madrid. Enton:First and foremost as a lifelong Liverpool fan, losing Trent would be a massive blow ….that's a no brainer. However, I think he's made his mind up and who can blame him? When Real Madrid comes knocking, you answer the door! Having built his friendship with Jude Bellingham via England duty, the process of settling in will be a lot easier as well. It's up to Liverpool now to try to get the best deal possible (if it's not too late). For maybe the first time I agree with Jamie Carragher's view on this and in Conor Bradley we have a super talented replacement. In essence it would be a massive blow losing Trent, but Bradley has shown he can play at the levels Arne Slot is demanding from his team. Russ:Trent has been at the club for 20 years and has won absolutely everything so you can understand if he wants a change of scene. What he needs to understand is that he will never be adored by the Madrid fans like he is at Anfield. He will never get to captain the club he supposedly loves and he will never win the Ballon D'or regardless of which club he plays for. He will be always be welcomed back to Anfield but not with open arms - he has tarnished his legacy like Owen and McManaman. Ryan:Devastated. The best right-back of his generation, a local lad and one of the most exciting players to watch. To see him sell out to join Madrid feels like a dagger in the heart. If he wins the league before he goes, you'd say 'c'est la vie' and we move on. If he does go, the club absolutely MUST tie down Salah and Virgil van Dijk to soften the blow. Fraser:Whereas Salah and Virgil have made it clear that they want to stay (and I'm fairly confident that both will extend) Trent has been quiet the whole time which makes me fear the worst. The thing that infuriates me most is that he is trying to leave on a free and Liverpool get nothing in return. This is very disappointing from Trent and pretty selfish from him as well, I just hope this doesn't sabotage or derail our campaign. Good thing Conor Bradley is near to returning."

The Athletic have since reported that Liverpool turned down Real Madrid's approach. Owen said:, external""The very fact that Real Madrid have now made their intentions clear towards signing Trent Alexander-Arnold leads me to believe that it's only a matter of time before he signs for them. If he was going to sign a contract extension, Madrid wouldn't have officially made their move. Secretive talks will have taken place. Huge news."" Ex-defenderJamie Carragher also said on X, external: ""The most important thing for Liverpool in 2025 is winning the Premier League. No one's contract or future should come in the way of that! I love Trent as a lad and a player, but his team would've told Real Madrid to bid and also would've known Liverpool would turn it down. It's to try and cover themselves when he leaves for free.

Manchester Citybecame history makers in 2024 as they sealed their fourth successive Premier League title in May and their sixth in seven seasons. Pep Guardiola's possession based football continued to dominate as they maintained the ball for an average of 64.5% per game and had a 90.6% passing accuracy over the year. Brightonwere the closest to matching their accuracy at 87.5% and Ange Postecoglou's similar high-risk football sawTottenhamretain 61.3% possession. Under Jurgen Klopp and new head coach Arne Slot,Liverpoolscored 92 goals in 2024 which is three more thanArsenaland nine greater than City. The Reds registered 741 shots in total, which is a stark contrast toLeicester Citywho recorded the least with 170. Albeit that is only since their promotion back to the top-flight in the summer. Of those shots, 286 of Liverpool's were on target. But it is Thomas Frank'sBrentfordthat have proven to be the most clinical. The Bees had a conversion rare of 15.3% after scoring 62 goals in the Premier League. Yoane Wissa found the back of the net 17 times, while Bryan Mbuemo registered 12 goals. From goal scoring to conceding -West Hamturned over the most goals with 79. They should look to North London for tips on how to tighten up their defence as Arsenal proved to be the most solid across all aspects of their back line. The Gunners conceded just 25 goals across the course of the year and kept an impressive 18 clean sheets. Sean Dyche'sEverton, renowned for being stubborn to break down, kept 14 clean sheets despite only winning eight of their 36 games. All stats are supplied by Opta"
3/17/2025,12:04,'I think the club is playing this well',"The biggest question in English football right now surrounds Mo Salah. It is not the one about whether he did or did not mean that piece of skill for Liverpool's second goal againstWest Ham. He probably did not mean the little flick, but it was still genius to react to the fluke so quickly and make the best of it. The real question is about the contract. ""Surely with his phenomenal form they must give him what he wants,"" is the mournful cry I hear from Liverpool fans. We do not know the details but what if he was wanting a four-year deal for his security and Liverpool were only offering one year? Because at his age when the downhill slide happens it could be very quick. How would Liverpool feel paying someone £20m (allegedly) per annum for the last three years of a contract for what by then might be an aging bit-part player? But Mo is world class, he is in great shape for a 33-year old (as he will be at the start of his next contracted year), he is not a drinker and what about his contemporaries Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo? Messi won the World Cup at 35 and though less mobile was still crucial to that victory. Cristiano, now nudging 40, is still looking good and banging in the goals, at an admittedly lower level. Salah might do the same. However, the 'might' in this sentence is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Liverpool FC is a business and though the reward of giving Mo and his people what they want could be high, the risk is also substantial in the medium to long term. I think the club is playing this well, eventually they will have to live without the Egyptian genius, so they might as well start preparing for that day. In the meantime, a shorter contract, a year maybe, with a option on a second season, looks the most likely and indeed sensible outcome for all parties. If Mo agrees!

Arne Slot's side opened up an eight-point gap at the top of the table with their win at London Stadium, although that could be closed by bothChelseaandArsenalby the time Liverpool hostManchester Unitedon 5 January. ""We're on 29 December - let's speak about this in April or May,"" Van Dijk said. ""For us it's now about time with our families - it's precious and important time that we need - and then we focus on United. ""I'm not going to speak about any title, because there's no point. I've been in these title races in the past, we've lost twice by small margins and won it once [in 2019-20] quite comfortably and it was an amazing feeling.

3/17/2025,14:18,Liverpool attack with 'dynamism' - Murphy,"Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy has praised Arne Slot's attacking tactics, after the Reds stretched the gap at the top of the Premier League table to eight points. Speaking on Match of the Day, Murphy said: ""They have got more players than anybody else who are prepared to run in behind without the ball. They do it with such dynamism. It is incredible. ""It is obviously a tactic. It takes willingness from the players, energy and commitment. It pushes the [opposition] defence back and gets Liverpool up the pitch. ""Luis Diaz has been playing in that number-nine role and he has been doing it brilliantly because he is always willing to run in behind. ""The runs create space for Mohamed Salah, who is always getting into the right positions in the box. ""We see so many players in the Premier League coming to feet all the time, but Salah is probably the best at doing it. He knows when to run in behind and use his pace, especially when he has got Trent [Alexander-Arnold] feeding him."" Former Premier League defender Ashley Williams added: ""As a centre-back or any defender, there is confusion. They don't know if there is an offside, they don't know whether to stay with the runner or go to the player who is going to feet. ""Liverpool are so dynamic in this - Salah is on his bike as soon as he knows that someone has got their head up and it is so difficult to defend against."" Catch up on Match of the Day here"

3/17/2025,11:27,"Salah, Diaz and Gakpo 'tuned into the same wavelength'","With Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane now elsewhere, Arne Slot has teamed Mohamed Salah up with two potent allies - inherited from Jurgen Klopp - who are increasingly making this look a season when the Premier League title will return to Anfield. All three of them scored in the thumpingvictory at London Stadium. Luis Diaz, who netted twice in the6-3 winatTottenhamseven days before thisWest Hamrout, set them on their way. After being utilised as a winger when he arrived from Porto in January 2022, Slot now has the Colombian working the central areas to great effect. Perhaps without Firmino's elegance but with real impact, especially as his finishing has become more reliable. And, on the left, the rangy and dangerous Cody Gakpo has found his natural home, a position where he was one of the stars of Euro 2024 for the Netherlands. He is a scorer and creator, with an ability to come in off the flank and make decisive contributions, while also showing a natural finisher's eye. Diaz's natural attraction to the wide areas also increases Liverpool's options in attack - but what makes them so dangerous is that Salah, Diaz and Gakpo are such a natural fit. They are three high-class operators tuned in to the same wavelength. Read Phils full piece over here"

""The gap is already large and nothing seems to faze them. What I really love about them is their ability to slow a game down at one moment and then speed it up and go direct the next. ""We have seen, in the history of sport, teams or individuals who look like they're set to win a gold medal or a league title and have faltered. But the way Liverpool have been under Arne Slot, I just can't see that happening. They're brushing teams away. ""West Ham aren't the strongest opponents they're going to face in the Premier League but, even when they have faced their so-called rivals, they've come away relatively unscathed or beaten them. ""At the moment, looking around Europe, you would make them not just favourites to win the Premier League but you'd make them favourites to win the Champions League as well. ""It's daunting for the chasing pack because you can't really see them going on a really bad run that would allow that lead they've got to be whittled away.""

3/17/2025,09:07,West Ham 0-5 Liverpool - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts afterSunday's Premier League gamebetween West Ham and Liverpool, which the Reds won 5-0. Here are some of your comments: West Ham fans James: It's really scary how easy teams can play through us. Our defence do not show an eagerness to get the ball, unlike our competitors. We make far too many mistakes and choose wrong options going forward. If Niclas Fullkrug needs to play, I'd rather see Jarrod Bowen on the left and Mohammed Kudus on the right. I don't know why we keep playing Paqueta either - he clearly has lost all motivation to try his best. The manager needs to go, and Graham Potter needs to come in. Now. Michael: Truly awful performance. Just can't do the basics. I don't blame the manager. This is on the players and they were very poor. Spineless really. Binner:Disappointed. To be honest, I didn't expect a different result with the way Liverpool have been playing, but our performance was disappointing. All you David Moyes haters; what do you say now, eh? Fraser: We've got the worst goal difference outside the bottom three and, time and time again, defence is our weakest area. It was the same towards the end of the Moyes era - heavy defeats have become commonplace. We have talented defenders so there must be something lacking in terms of organisation, tactics and teamwork at the back. Get that sorted and the rest of the team have something to build on. Liverpool fans Shay: Liverpool were brilliant going forward but that was also a very poor West Ham team defensively. Mohamed Salah is surely in line for the Ballon d'Or next year if he keeps this up. Only Cole Palmer comes close to him in world football right now. Bigger tests to come but nice to see all our frontline get a goal. Over reliance on Mo may be also be our downfall were he to get injured. Stephen: Another well disciplined display. Could have been double figures. Forget the contract problems - the three in question are not showing any discomfort and are just getting on with it. Role on Man Utd. Paul: Great team performance -high intensity, attacking flair, intuitive passing and finishing. Massive gulf between these sides. Confidence is clearly high. Can Liverpool keep it up? Still plenty of harder challenges ahead. Nick: Strolled through the game and never really got out of second gear. The transition from Jurgen Klopp to Arne Slot reminds me of when Bob Paisley took over from Bill Shankly - a more calming hand on the wheel."

3/17/2025,20:01,'Lots of goals but loads of chances as well' - Slot,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot, speaking to BBC Match of the Day: ""Yeah [lots of goals] but loads of chances as well. It was 3-0 at half time but soon after that we could have scored three. ""On the other side it was good that not every chance that they had went in, they had two or three, one hit the post and one hit the bar. Against Leicester they had one chance and scored. We were a bit unlucky that we did not score in the first few minutes but as well we were lucky that at 1-0 Kudus hit the post. ""[Clean sheets] are one of the reasons why you win a lot. If every time you have to score two, three or four goals it is difficult, at the moment we do but it is not sustainable for a longer period of time. Sometimes you need a win by keeping a clean sheet and scoring one or two. ""At the end we did not need our clean sheet but it is always good for the confidence of the back line and goalkeepers. ""If a player makes a sprint then asks to go out we know it is a hamstring and it will not take one or two days to fix. The positive thing was that Joe [Gomez]'s replacement Jarrell Quansah played an amazing game. That shows how important the squad is. On losing just one game in 2024: ""Compliments to Nottingham Forest. They were the one."""

3/17/2025,11:32,Sutton's predictions: West Ham v Liverpool,"Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests. This week, he takes on musician Emma-Jean Thackray, who is a Leeds fan. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Is anyone going to be able to stop Liverpool? I don't think West Ham will. To be fair to the Hammers, they are level on points with Spurs and above Manchester United in the table, so maybe their season is just a slow burner. So far, they have been underwhelming under Julen Lopetegui, but they have now put together a four-game unbeaten run and Jarrod Bowen seems to have become their go-to player in recent weeks. Liverpool's ability to rotate their team could be key again here, though. They did that against Leicester last time out, when Dominik Szoboszlai and Luis Diaz dropped to the bench - I had Diaz as my Fantasy captain, so I was not happy - but it made no difference to the way they played. Arne Slot has such great quality right through his squad that I just think the Reds will keep rolling on. They won't have as much fun as they didthe last time they were in London, but they should leave with the points again. Emma-Jean's prediction: 1-2 OK, so I really want Liverpool to win the league because there is a weird statistic where the past three times Leeds have been promoted to the top flight, they have been champions - 1963-64, 1989-90 and 2019-20. That bit of stat magic might make all the difference for us this time too. As for this game? Well it should be a good watch and it is going to be tighter than people think, but I am backing Liverpool. That is not through any sort of love of them - only for Leeds United! Read the full predictions and have your say here"
3/17/2025,17:00,'We need to create our own history',"Alisson is reluctant to draw comparisons between Liverpool's team this season and the side that won the Premier League in 2020. Liverpool have a handsome lead at the top of the table, with a game in hand on their fellow title challengers. The Reds were similarly dominant in 2019-20, sitting 10 points clear after 17 Premier League games. But goalkeeper Alisson said: ""I don't think they are too similar. [They are] two different teams. ""A few players [from 2019-20] still play but we have a different style now. We have more ball possession. Before it was a lot more straightforward with a lot of transition and intensity. That team was really special. ""I think there is no comparison with both situations. There are more different things than similarities. I think the press look more for these kind of things. I don't believe we have to compare ourselves with the past, we have to create our own history. ""What makes me happy is this group of players having the quality to do something special. The most important thing is the commitment needed to win something is there. That is all we are focused on. ""What we are doing, or what we can do, will not erase what we did in the past."""
3/17/2025,13:02,West Ham v Liverpool: Did you know?,"Liverpool have conceded 10 goals in their past four Premier League away games and at least twice each time. However, they have not lost any of these games (won two drawn two). No team in Premier League history has conceded multiple goals in five consecutive away games and avoided defeat each time."
3/17/2025,14:47,How important is Van Dijk to Liverpool?,"Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Judging bythe rhetoricaround Virgil van Dijk signing for Liverpool on this day in 2017, few expected the Netherlands defender to be a game-changing £75m signing. ""A joke"". ""Absurd"". ""Crazy money"". As it happened, he transformed everything. Arguably the Premier League's pre-eminent centre-back, Van Dijk has chalked up 177 wins in the competition, which puts him 16th on the all-time list for defenders. Only Jonny Evans (188), Ashley Young (212) and Kyle Walker (258) of current defenders can boast more. Within 18 months of moving to Anfield, he had won the Champions League. Within two and a half years, he had added the Premier League title. Since then, his importance to the Reds was emphasised in 2020-21 when he was ruled out for the rest of the season in October and Liverpool's title defence crumbled without him. Liverpool's win percentage with and without the formidable Dutchman is stark - 70.1% against 51.1%. Now, he continues to marshal a backline that up until the beginning of December had only conceded eight goals in the Premier League. Arne Slot called him the club's ""leader"" on Friday and there is no doubt that when he is on the pitch, Liverpool are more fearsome for it. If he is to make it eight years (and more) as a Red, then Liverpool will need him to sign a new deal before the summer - especially important because clubs outside England will be able to begin pre-contract talks with Van Dijk from Wednesday. Where's the pen?"
3/17/2025,13:56,Van Dijk 'the vocal leader of the team',"Friday marks the seventh anniversary of Liverpool's announcement thatVirgil van Dijk would be joining the Redsfrom Southampton for £75m. During his time at Anfield, the Netherlands centre-back has helped Liverpool to numerous trophies,  including the 2019 Champions League and 2019-20 Premier League title. Reds boss Arne Slot has spoken about how much Van Dijk, now Liverpool's captain, ""leads by example"" in the dressing room. ""I can only tell you about my experiences are with him and it is not only what you see - because you see during the games and he is outstanding during the games - but he has such a big impact in training sessions as well,"" said Slot. ""He is the vocal leader of the team and every time we start an exercise, he is on top of his team-mates. He leads by example. ""For me, he has been outstanding until now and we can only hope he can continue showing this during the games and the training sessions as long as he is with us."""
3/17/2025,11:17,How do this year's Liverpool compare to title-winning season?,"Liverpool moved seven points clear at the top of the table last night after 17 games with 42 points. During their title-winning season in 2019-20, the Reds had 49 points out of a possible 51 at this stage, dropping points only in a 1-1 draw againstMan Utdat Old Trafford in October. TheOpta supercomputer, externalnow has Liverpool at 88% to win the title again, withArsenalbeing the next most likely at 10.3%."
3/17/2025,09:24,Liverpool 3-1 Leicester - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts afterThursday's Premier League gamebetween Liverpool and Leicester. Here are some of your comments: Liverpool fans Graham: I am extremely proud of what our boys have achieved this year, it is far from over but Arne Slot has built on Jurgen Klopp's legacy. Well done boys - keep up the good work. Shay: The amount of poor first-half performances, stretching back to last season under Klopp, is worrying. We do play with more control but ultimately we ran out of comebacks last season and fell off. I fear the same thing will happen again unless we start much better. It's something Slot noticed as well, so I am unclear why it's happening! Ian: Leicester were stubborn opponents but Liverpool persevered with some excellent football and came out deserved winners. I know I keep mentioning it but again Darwin Nunez was disappointing - we need to invest in a proper number nine. Yusuf: This Liverpool side has matured greatly over the past months. Even when going behind, they knew how to manage the game and then came flying out of the blocks and scored three well-worked goals. The team's core has stayed the same since the start of last season and now it feels like it can only be ourselves that stop us winning our games. Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah with two outstanding goals. Leicester fans Jane: Liked the desire for large parts but I think we are bang in trouble with the lack of quality in the squad. Positives to take but I think Ruud van Nistelrooy will be fighting a losing battle. Richie: We were always expecting to lose. How we lost matters, and the desire to fight has been absent for the past few managers. So all in all… not a bad performance! James: This was a much-improved defensive display that in the end was eventually breached by an impressive Liverpool, who took their time to get going. However, other than Jordan Ayew's finish on the turn, Leicester barely laid a glove on Liverpool with Patson Daka and Stephy Mavididi wasteful with their few opportunities. One goal in their past three showcases a bluntness to their play that will need to be put right, as well as having defensive frailties fixed. Got one heck of a job on your hands Ruud. Richard: Too many players looked light. Men against boys at times. Daka shows why he's not Premier League standard - he gets knocked off the ball too easily. Leicester need a total overhaul. Keep the faith...keep our fingers crossed!"
3/17/2025,09:20,'Goals from absolutely everywhere',"Former Premier League goalkeeper Joe Hart praised Liverpool's attacking options on Match of the Day:""In play, they look uncontrollable. ""You have got the inevitability of Mohamed Salah - as an opposition you have to factor in that he is going to score in the game. Luis Diaz is chipping in with big goals, and Cody Gakpo looks like he is so in control. Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez are causing absolute chaos while Dominik Szoboszlai is capable from distance. ""There are goals from absolutely everywhere."" Alan Shearer added:""They are absolutely unbelievable in forward positions.

Sutton's prediction: 4-0 Liverpool absolutely smashedTottenhamon Sunday with a brilliant display of power, energy and attacking thrust. They were brilliant. My only criticism of their performance is that they could have been more clinical and should have reached double figures with the chances they created. The worry for Leicester as they head to Anfield is that they are leaking lots of chances anyway, whoever they face. They will sit in, and try to shut up shop, but it won't make any difference - they will not be able to cope with Liverpool's firepower. Even if Reds boss Arne Slot makes changes, they still create lots of chances and the only real question is how many they will score. I am being nice by saying Liverpool will only get four.

Former Feyenoord manager Slot will be facing a familiar Dutch compatriot in Ruud van Nistelrooy on Thursday, having led his side to the Eredivisie title ahead of the now Leicester boss' PSV team. ""Cody Gakpo was in his team so I'm happy he's in my team now for when we face Ruud, because I think Cody scored in both games [against Feyenoord],"" Slot added. ""Ruud is a very nice person, first of all. I met him once or twice. I think he did really well when he was at PSV because PSV for the last one and a half years, they've been on top of the league table. But, if you look at the second half of Ruud's season [2022-23], they didn't really lose [except for one game after the 2022 World Cup]. ""So it wasn't a surprise that after he left and they bought so many players. When he was working there Cody Gakpo and Noni Madueke were sold, but he still showed that he could compete for the title. ""A nice person, a good manager,. He did well at [Manchester] United as well. I'm looking forward to seeing him - especially if we win."""
3/17/2025,08:13,Did you know?,No current Premier League player has been involved in more goals (six) or provided more assists (four) on Boxing Day than Liverpool's Mohamed Salah.
3/17/2025,20:22,What's Christmas like for a player?,"For me, wherever I played, I'd always see where the first game was, where the last game was, and where we were at Christmas. There is such a big difference between being at home on Boxing Day versus being away because, depending on what your manager is like, if you've got an away game there is a chance you're training on Christmas Day. Some of the toughest times I had was when we had away games on Boxing Day and we had to come in to train at four or five on Christmas. That's when everything is just starting at home and everyone is really enjoying themselves and you have to leave. If you lose you are sat in the hotel having walked away from friends and family all for no points. It's not the best feeling and as a consequence you bring home some of that disappointment with you. But, in reality, you just know it is the busiest time of the year. The floodlights are always on for the games, the conditions get that little bit tougher, you've got games it feels like every three or four days. I think it's an exciting part of the season because you can gain real, significant momentum but ultimately it comes down to are you winning games. I think the Christmas period itself can be tough if you have got family but in reality it always feels nicer when you get that win on Boxing Day. The atmosphere in the stadiums is a little bit different, the atmosphere among the players is a bit different. You're very thankful to get the chance to do what you do, but if you end up losing on Boxing Day or around that spell it is rubbish because it almost feels like it was a waste of time with all the efforts you put in. But, I get it. The fans love it, there is a lot of clamour around it. You lose track of days just like everyone else does after Christmas and before New Year but it is great to play in front of those types of crowds and it just does feel different playing during that week or two. Nedum Onuoha was speaking to BBC Sport's Nat Hayward"
3/17/2025,15:38,My moment of the year,"It has to be on the final day of last season, when Jurgen Klopp announced his successor by chanting the name Arne Slot in front of a packed and emotional Anfield. The moment summed up Klopp's personality - happy to put others forward instead of stealing the limelight. Nobody in the crowd that day expected it. It was genuinely jaw-dropping. Slot was the favourite for the job, but it hadn't been officially announced before Klopp went into song. It is now becoming increasingly iconic due to the fact emerging that Slot is a phenomenal replacement - maybe even an upgrade. He has lost only one game since taking charge, a home defeat against Nottingham Forest which he continually references as something he will not let happen again. Liverpool are top of the Premier League table, have won six out of six in the Champions League and are still in both domestic cup competitions. No new manager in the history of English football has had such a winning start, and remember, Slot hardly entered the transfer market, only signing an injured Federico Chiesa for this season, with the Italian barely featuring. Slot has massively improved Ryan Gravenberch, Cody Gakpo, Curtis Jones and Trent Alexander-Arnold. Mo Salah has always been good, but under Slot, he's the best player in the world. That day when Klopp past on the baton could signal the start of a trophy-laden era. Find more from Jordan Chamberlain atEmpire of the Kop, external"
3/17/2025,14:26,'It's very special what we are all witnessing' - Gakpo on Salah,"Liverpool forward Cody Gakpo says he hopes to play with winger Mohamed Salah for a long time. The Egyptian has the most goal involvements of any player across Europe's top five leagues this season as the Reds enter the festive period. ""It's very special what we are all witnessing,"" Gakpo told the club's website. ""The amount of goals he scores but the assists he gives as well, the way he plays the game, how he puts other attacking players or midfielders like myself in a position to score and to be dangerous is from a high level. ""I hope for us and for him that he can continue doing that for a long time. We are very lucky to have him and proud that we can be his team-mate and try to make him better.

The Athletic's Rory Smith agreed, suggesting they should be favourites but it is too early in the season to make that claim. Sutton reflected on the Reds' form and 6-3 weekend win at Tottenham, stating: ""Because of the nature and the strength of the Premier League, they will have a blip.

""I'm not getting dragged into talking about winning one, two, three or four trophies. It is all about each and every game ahead of us.

3/17/2025,14:44,'Two of the best crossers I've seen',"BBC Chief football writer Phil McNulty has been answering your questions on all things Premier League. G, the Evertonian asked:Hi Phil, Gary Neville said Trent Alexander-Arnold was one of the bests crossers of a ball in Premier League history. Who would you rate as top? I think Trent Alexander-Arnold is the best with mentions to Beckham, Shearer, Baines and De Bruyne. Phil answered:Afternoon, G: I think Alan Shearer was more of a beneficiary of crosses than a crosser himself but all the others are very worthy of mention. I'd go with Beckham and Alexander-Arnold with not much between them. In fact I'm thinking De Bruyne as well now! You mention you are an Evertonian. I don't know if you are old enough to remember Dave Thomas in the late 70s team but he was as good as I have seen – left foot, right foot, on the run, standing start, set pieces. If you are not old enough, ask someone about him."
3/17/2025,13:12,Are Liverpool 'unstoppable'?,"Liverpool have a ""level of smugness"" about them which is ""wonderful to watch"", says former goalkeeper David James. The Reds' impressive 6-3 win away toTottenhamon Sunday saw Arne Slot's side move four points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand. It also continued the incredible record of the new Liverpool boss having only lost once since taking charge of the club in the summer. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast, James said: ""There is a side to this Liverpool team and Arne Slot and everyone, they don't seem to mind other teams playing well against them at some point during the game, i.e scoring goals and Tottenham scored three goals. ""If you had said to someone you are going to go to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and concede three goals, how do you feel? Well you would say 'we will probably score four, we might even score six'. It's a level of smugness, which I say in the fondest way, that no one else in the league has this year and it's wonderful to watch."" Ex-Tottenham defender Stephen Kelly also praised the Reds for their season so far and added: ""I think it is a foot race between Liverpool and Liverpool. I don't think anyone catches them. ""They are just so decisive and so cutting in games in moments when they need to be. If they had some key injuries to key players then that could change things obviously with the run-in left but you just look at them and think 'this team are unstoppable at the moment'. ""I can't see anyone getting to the level to really pose a threat."" Listen back on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,09:07,'Arguably his greatest performance for Liverpool',"Dominik Szoboszlai has turned it around and Liverpool are purring. Arne Slot's efficient Reds were still winning at the start of the season, but many were worried about our Hungarian number eight. Back in the later summer, he was probably the least in-form starting player. He lacked creativity and his decision making was off. Luckily, he has always been a physical monster off the ball, so he pretty much kept his place in the side while rotating with Curtis Jones. But in the past few weeks, Szoboszlai has really stepped up. AgainstTottenhamon Sunday was arguably his greatest performance for Liverpool. Slot used him very high up, with Szoboszlai often playing further ahead than Luis Diaz, who was the striker. The attacking midfielder linked up with Mo Salah repeatedly, drove through the centre of the park and provided a killer instinct in the box. Given he has got Jones and fit again Harvey Elliott breathing down his neck for chances, it was the perfect time for Szoboszlai to step up, especially given Liverpool have been heavily linked to playmaker Rayan Cherki for the January transfer window. It could not be going any better for Liverpool. The players are on song, fit and capable of beating anybody. The strength in depth is also underrated. What other side can beat Tottenham away from home, 6-3, with Darwin Nunez, Diogo Jota, Elliott, Jones, Wataru Endo, Caoimhin Kelleher and Jarell Quansah on the bench?

3/17/2025,08:18,Tottenham 3-6 Liverpool - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts after Sunday's Premier League game between Tottenham and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Tottenham fans Rachael:Our shortcomings and naivety were ruthlessly exploited by a great Liverpool team. I don't think our best XI, had they been available, could have matched Liverpool. If you watched that game as a neutral, you would enjoy that - but not as a Spurs fan. Steve:Shambles from the coach yet again. Yes, we are missing defenders but we conceded goals galore when they were fit. There is no structure or balance to team and that is down to the coach. Why play a high-line against the fastest front three in the league? Brave? Brainless is the answer. He is on borrowed time. Andrew:Simply shocking. There are no excuses. Nothing learned, the same spineless performance. Sack manager and start again. Martin:I don't believe we can keep persisting with this style of football. I want Spurs to play good, attractive football, but not with this suicidal approach to defending and pressing. We don't have the quality or depth of squad to do this. Ange Postecoglou, rethink please. Mickey:We are further off the top teams than we have been for many years. Ange is great as a 'mate', but we need more than that. Liverpool fans Kojo:This was always going to be a high-scoring game, given Spurs' all-attacking, high-pressing game. They might have overpoweredManchester Cityand other clubs but, against a rampant Liverpool, Tottenham's high line was exposed with swift counter-attacks, defence splitters and balls behind the line. Spurs were lucky not to concede double digits here. Dax:I don't like saying this, but I would have taken a 2-0 win over a 6-3 win. Yes, Tottenham were there for the taking but our defence should have been more solid. We have been horribly exposed in recent games, shipping three goals atNewcastle,two atSouthamptonandFulham. Stronger teams would have hammered us. We are becoming complacent and too confident. Earlier in the season, our defence was almost impenetrable. Conceding 11 goals in five games isn't good enough. Charlie:Fantastic again. I'm not happy conceding three goals, but they are human after all. We have just got to keep the momentum going. If we can win the game in hand, it bodes well for the title, but we can't afford a blip. Derek:Great performance from the team. Gomez was outstanding at the back and Salah was just phenomenal up front. Six goals scored, but it could have been 10. Alfie:Formidable side. They haven't even come out of first gear. It is incredible football to watch. One at a time, bring them all on and smash them all. At least two trophies this campaign, one of those the Premier League title. A brilliant team, well done Liverpool."
3/17/2025,08:08,Slot 'has brought a high level of consistency',"Arne Slot is making Premier League management ""look way too easy"", says formerWest Hammidfielder Nigel Reo-Coker on BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. Liverpool are top of the Premier League and Champions League tables, with a place in the Carabao Cup semi-finals also booked. ""No-one really had a clue what to expect from Slot because of everything that Jurgen Klopp achieved and the impact when he left,"" said Reo-Coker. ""So no-one thought they would be competing for the Premier League title - maybe a top-four finish, but not a title when there was so much uncertainty about what Slot would bring. ""What he has brought is a great level of professionalism and high level of consistency and performance from every single player. No matter what his starting line-up is, it is always the highest level in the Premier League and Champions League. ""Every player seems tuned in and dialled in, so you have to give full credit to Slot because only a very good manager can do that. ""They are a well-oiled machine.""

We are not happy with the fact we conceded three goals, that is very clear, but we scored six and that's not very easy. ""Tottenham are a good team. They press really high and they are aggressive. We knew we had to put the ball in behind and score the opportunities we had. ""We are happy with the result. There are many things to improve but we are happy to get the three points."" On the performance of team-mate Dominik Szoboszlai:""Dom is amazing. He can do everything and on and off the ball he is really good. He played a really good game, the same with the attackers. We are in a really good moment."" On conceding more goals recently:""At the back, we have to play simple and get the ball to them [the attackers]. We worked on this the whole week and we try to improve every single day. ""We know we have to concede less. We are not happy with conceding three today, but it is what it is.

3/17/2025,18:53,'They play an intense game',"Liverpool goalscorer Mohamed Salah has been speaking to Sky Sports about the win:""We were quite good up front, but defensively we need to improve as a team. Conceding three goals is quite hard. ""It is a good result, hopefully we just keep going."" On playing against this Spurs team:""We expected that [a chaotic game]. The way they play, they open the game, they enjoy their football, they are physically tough so mentally we always have to be in the game. ""They don't change much in the way they play, it is intense. Manchester City came here and struggled, other teams too. ""I'm happy we won because they play an intense game."" On becoming the first player ever to score 10 goals and provide 10 assists in the Premier League before Christmas:""I didn't think about it before the game, but I'm glad I have done it. It is something that makes me proud, I'll keep working hard."" On becoming Liverpool's fourth all-time leading goalscorer:""It is great to achieve that at such a big club but the most important thing is that we won the game. Wherever I am going to end my career, I am happy about it."" When asked if there is an update on his future, he replied:""No."""

3/17/2025,12:07,Sutton's predictions: Tottenham v Liverpool,"Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests. For week 17, he takes on Reverend & the Makers singer Jon McClure. Sutton's prediction: 2-3 Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou said this week that management is a harder job than being prime minister and, from my spell in charge of Lincoln, I can testify to that. Postecoglou knows all about the highs and lows that managers can experience from one week to the next, because that has been the story of Spurs' season. The same might apply just to this game too. While I think Tottenham will get some joy because it is going to be action packed, Liverpool will not lie down and I fancy them to come out on top. How Spurs deal with Mohamed Salah on the counter-attack is going to be key, but I cannot see them stopping him completely. People might look at Liverpool's draw with Fulham last weekend and think it was not a great result for Arne Slot's side but I was there and, honestly, the way they played with 10 men was incredible. They looked like they were the team with the extra man. McClure's prediction: 1-2 Spurs are weird because you never know if they are going to turn up or not. Like Sheffield Wednesday (who McClure supports), they seem better away from home, too. I don't know if it is because they play on the break? I am going with Liverpool here though. They have made the appointment of the decade in Slot. He has kept what was good about the Jurgen Klopp era - the high press and all that - but they just seem a little bit more street smart. I have to say I love his interview style too because he is very honest. I think he is wonderful and think he is going to do great things at Liverpool. Read the full predictions and have your say"

3/17/2025,17:33,Slot admires Alexander-Arnold's legacy hopes,"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot likes the fact Trent Alexander-Arnold wants to be remembered as the world's best right-back. The England international, whose contract at Anfield is up in the summer, said in an interview this week that his motivation was to build a legacy which would see him spoken about long after he had retired. ""I definitely like this in a player,"" said Slot. ""I think this is something every player must have if you play at this level and if you don't have this then you probably don't play at this level. ""As long as they understand that they need the team to be special as an individual. As long as they put the team first and as a result be special themselves, that is what they all do - including Trent. ""All the top players have this, they want to be special, they want to be the best. If that's not what you have I think it is so hard to put the effort in to stay fit, to be good every three days. ""You always see them during the game and you probably think 'what a life these players have' and it is true, they have a great life, but they have to put a lot of work in to be able to at their best every three days. That is not given to everyone, that mentality and discipline, and therefore that's the mentality of a top player and part of that is you need and want to be the best possible player in your position or the best player in the world."""
3/17/2025,16:18,Slot praise for Postecoglou tactics at Spurs,"This video can not be played  It is not often you hear a Premier League manager saying he wants one of his rivals to win a trophy but that was the case when Liverpool boss Arne Slot spoke about Tottenham counterpart Ange Postecoglou earlier today. Slot, who was heavily linked with Spurs in 2023, expressed his view as, for the good of football, he wants Postecoglou to earn some physical recognition for his attacking tactics at the London club. And, while Slot will be rooting for Tottenham in the Europa League rather than stopping the Reds winning any silverware, he will not want Spurs taking any points off his side when they meet in the league on Sunday (16:30 GMT). Liverpool could be usurped at the Premier League summit before they play ifChelseawin atEvertonbut, although the Reds have had their lead cut following two top-flight draws, Slot was not showing any signs of being troubled by such a scenario. Instead, he pointed out that the league table should only be used as a guide at the 19 game mark when everyone has played each other. Slot has highlighted a few times this season how opposing teams have changed their tactics to nullify his team but, with Spurs unlikely to do so, it should make for entertaining viewing on Sunday."
3/17/2025,10:03,"Slot on academy players, Chiesa's competition and Spurs","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Sunday's Premier League game atTottenham(kick-off 16:30 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Centre-back Ibrahima Konate and right-back Conor Bradley are the only two players who are injured and yet to return to team training. He said the effort he and the performance team put into the pre-season plan has been rewarded because only these two were injured: ""We gave them quite a lot of days off - although the players wouldn't agree, I'm sure - and I feel we find the benefits of that in this moment. Meanwhile, Italy forward Federico Chiesa ""is definitely getting stronger"" after building up his minutes on Wednesday atSouthampton, but he is ""also facing a lot of competition in that right-wing position"". On giving academy players a chance in the Carabao Cup: ""Most of the clubs [left in the competition] have played with their starters and only a few have picked non-starters. If we miss a few players, then we take a look at our academy and that is part of our identity. There is always room for them."" He said the return of Harvey Elliott was ""a boost for the team"" and having his players return at this stage of the season is ""so important"" when competing on four fronts. Slot likened how he tells the players to manage games as to how he is as a father: ""If you don't tell them a few things regularly enough, they tend to forget! Re-application is so important for a team. Maybe small details change, as football changes, but the main message has always been the same."" Slot said drawing Tottenham in the semi-final of the Carabao Cup ""is interesting"" but there were ""four top teams still in it, so no easy one."" He has been impressed by Spurs despite an inconsistent first half of the season: ""I really have to give them credit because if I look at Tottenham, they have always been a certain brand and identity and [Ange] Postecoglou has given them that identity back completely. It is a joy to watch them."" More on Postecoglou's attacking set-up: ""I hope, hope, hope he wins a trophy, but not the League Cup! A fan for the Europa League. Trophies are important and his brand of football is important. If he wins, then you can stop talking about his style being too attacking.""

3/17/2025,08:16,Slot aims to get back to winning ways,"If things had worked out differently, then Arne Slot could have been in the opposing dugout when his Liverpool side take onTottenhamon Sunday (16:30 GMT). The Dutchman washeavily linked with taking over at Spursin 2023 but instead stayed on at Feyenoord before becoming Reds boss last summer. Tottenham's loss has proved to be Liverpool's gain as Slot has won 20 of his 24 games in charge so far and the Anfield club are top of the Premier League, Champions League group and into the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup. However, Slot will want his team to get back to winning ways in the league at Tottenham and we will get his thoughts when he speaks to the media at 09:15 GMT today. The Reds have had a nine-point lead at the top of the table reduced to two by Chelsea and could go into the Spurs game in second place if the Blues win at Everton in a 14:00 GMT kick-off on Sunday. Liverpool have drawn their past two Premier League games and had the derby at Everton postponed, while Chelsea have won three games in that same period as part of a run of five victories in a row. Slot will be hoping his players are fresh and firing on all cylinders at Tottenham after most were rested for the midweek win at Southampton in the League Cup. Alisson Becker, Luis Diaz, Virgil van Dijk, Ryan Gravenberch, Curtis Jones, Dominic Szoboszlai and Mohamed Salah did not travel to the south coast to play Southampton in the Carabao Cup this week so should be back, along with Andy Robertson, who was suspended. Slot will also be back on the touchline for the game after having to watch the cup win at St Mary's Stadium from the stands."
3/17/2025,22:43,Carabao Cup semi-final draw made,"The draw for the Carabao Cup semi-finals has been made, with Tottenham paired with holders Liverpool and Arsenal set to face Newcastle. The two-legged semi-final ties will take place in week commencing 6 January (first leg) and week commencing 3 February (second leg). Spurs completed the line-up for the last four with their victory over Manchester United on Thursday."
3/17/2025,15:28,Slot hopes for more than 'good moments' from Chiesa,"Federico Cheisa has made only four appearances since his move from Juventus to Liverpool, in a deal which could eventually be worth £12.5m. He came off the bench to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold in the 2-1 Carabao Cup win over Southampton and manager, Arne Slot said: ""I think what I saw is what you can expect. ""If a player is out for five or six months you cannot expect (too much). I saw ups and downs. ""I saw some really good moments and I saw some moments where I felt like, 'OK, you can do better than this.' For me, that's completely normal if a player has been out for so long. ""To get him back to his best is not easy. But it was good to see that he showed some quality already. ""But it's the same for him like the youngsters, it's not enough to play at this level, you have to compete with Mo Salah, Cody Gakpo, Lucho [Diaz], Darwin and Diogo. ""But it's good to see that he's back and that he had a few good moments in the game."""
3/17/2025,13:00,Gravenberch dictating affairs under Arne Slot,"Liverpool's transition from Jurgen Klopp to Arne Slot could barely have felt more seamless. The Reds have won 20 out of their 24 games across all competitions, losing just once. One player who has been key to that early success is midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, who has been deployed in the number six role under the Dutchman this term. Tactics writer Ninad Barbadikar takes a closer look his new role in the side. Slot's teams have been known to set up in a 4-2-3-1 formation on the pitch, which is a move away from Klopp's favoured 4-3-3. This change in system meant a new role for Netherlands midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, who now finds himself dictating affairs from the middle of the park having been asked to play higher as a 'number eight' under Klopp. Gravenberch brings a number of strengths to the table - press-resistance, awareness of space around him both in and out of possession and a passing ability which helps connect defence and attack. His move into the 'number six' role has meant Slot has been able to use Alexis Mac Allister further up the pitch in possession. In fact, Gravenberch's role in Liverpool's side this term mirrors the Argentine's role from last season. Moving Gravenberch further back has meant he has the space to both receive and turn away from markers. His progressive carries can be of huge help to Liverpool in getting up the pitch. However, the 22-year-old is still learning the role and has been stifled at times when pressed high by opponents - such as in the 3-3 draw at Newcastle - which can hit Liverpool's ability to build up.

3/17/2025,09:43,Southampton 1-2 Liverpool - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts afterWednesday's Carabao Cup quarter-finalbetween Southampton and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Southampton fans Laurie:I saw for the first time something I haven't seen since being promoted - a bit of real determination and proper team effort. And this was only Simon Rusk's first game. Paul Onuachu and Kamaldeen Sulemana made a huge difference and looked very dangerous. The truth is: the whole team have to start believing. I feel they are capable, especially now they are actually being allowed to adapt their game. Steve:Tough conditions but wow, what a difference! The shackles are off. If we keep that degree of effort, we could make a season of it yet. Mike:Any potential managerial candidate looking at last night's performance will no doubt be thinking twice or will want assurances of a war chest to patch up a defence that is holed below the waterline. When Jan Bednarek is your first-choice defender, you are truly in trouble. Nik:Rome wasn't built in a day, right? The second-half performance showed some spirit and fight, which was good to see. We are down and out - bar a miracle. It's going to be a long rest of the season but, as long as we show some spirit and some progress, I'll be back full of naive hope again in 2025-26! Liverpool fans Rudy:Another business-like performance from Liverpool. Mass changes but we still managed the win, despite a potential banana-skin. Credit Southampton as this performance was decades better than Sunday. That's 20 games unbeaten! The 'Slot Machine' rolls on! Geoff:Overall, an encouraging performance and a good indicator of our squad strength and depth. Two well-taken goals got us through a spirited Southampton fightback, and we deserved the positive result. From goalkeeper to forwards, we showed good skills and tenacity. A pleasing win. Roger:We conceded a very poor goal, which then put us under pressure for the rest of the game. The two defenders should have easily ushered Cameron Archer onto his left foot but, with no challenge coming in, he produced a great finish. Great to see Harvey Elliott back, scoring and playing well. We probably did just enough to win, based on the first half. Tim:The important thing is that we won in normal time and rested six of our first starters for Sunday. It was good to see some other players we don't normally get to watch. This was a game we just needed to get through without injuries."

3/17/2025,22:44,'Important win for our team' - Slot,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live:""It wasn't easy circumstances to play in because of the wind of course, but it was a very good and important win for our team. ""We saw a lot of players that maybe don't start, we saw a lot of players that have had an impact already, so for us to have these players playing games is important. ""It doesn't matter too much what your back line is if you have the ball as much as we did in the first half. Then you have control. Second half the control was not there as much so your defenders are exposed, especially if they are not defenders. ""We handled it really well and only conceded one or two chances. The second half wasn't as good as the first but it was enough in the end to bring the win over the line."""

""Some of us hadn't played so much this season. We also had really young lads in the team. But we fought as a team and thankfully we came away with a win."" On Southampton's performance:""I wouldn't say I was surprised by it because if you look at the Premier League, they caused problems for us as well. ""They are a side full of confidence and they are not scared to play out from the back and take risks. Credit to them, they caused problems for us today. ""We had to make sure we stood strong and defended as well as we can as a team. And despite conceding one goal, we did that really well."""

3/17/2025,12:01,'Careful game management' for Slot against Southampton,"So a change of scenery for Liverpool on Wednesday as they turn their attention to the Carabao Cup. Arne Slot has already hinted at changes, with some of his regular starters likely to get a rest. Diogo Jota will not start, but Slot will hope the forward will be fully fit soon as his clinical finishing can be a huge boost, as we saw againstFulhamon Saturday. Caoimhin Kelleher will start in goal, and there may be a chance for Federico Chiesa to get some minutes, but otherwise an opportunity for some of the young players to stake a claim - and we saw how effective that was in this competition last season. Southamptonmay be bottom of the table but it is still an away game against a Premier League side, and they did cause Liverpool a few problems in the recent league game at St Mary's. With a trip toTottenhamto come on Sunday, it will be a case of careful game management for the Reds' head coach, especially with a number of players still sidelined. But, he has been spot on with just about everything so far...

3/17/2025,08:04,Slot makes a point with brave approach,"Two points from six, but it isn't time to worry at Anfield... yet. The point againstFulhamafter being a goal down in 11 minutes and a man down after 17, felt like three. Knowing you can be competitive against good teams with only 10 men gives the group a huge lift.Evertonhelped by denyingArsenalall three points in north London, but how do teams cope best when they lose a man so early in a game? Changing system and going to a defensive 4-4-1 can be incredibly difficult to play against. Those two banks of four staying tight together are hard to get through. An organised deep 5-3-1 system is even worse, you might get a lot of the ball but you will get very little space. I prefer the maverick coaches. I had one who went for a 3-3-3 formation when we went a man down at 0-0 away from home, it utterly discombobulated the opposition. We weren't sitting back, we became the attacking team and incredibly we went on to win 2-0. Arne Slot frequently left three v three at the back against Fulham with no covering player. Brave. Had it backfired he would have looked naive, but it worked. They increased their work-rate, maintained 60% possession and managed not only to equalise twice, but were the team more likely to score at the end. His players will believe in him even more after he showed that he believed in them. Sign up to read more from Pat Nevin in his Football Extra newsletter"
3/17/2025,16:48,Left-back desire an 'overreaction and harsh' or 'justified'?,"We asked for your views on whether Liverpool should be looking at signing a new left-back in the January transfer market, or if it is not an area on the priority list yet. Here are some of your comments: Robby:All the chat about Andy Robertson and his recent poor form is unfortunately justified. He has, without doubt, been a tremendous servant to Liverpool. However, it is becoming clearer that his best days are over. If Kostas Tsimikas had not been plagued with injuries then he would have been selected before Robbo, for sure. Andy has been admired by Liverpool fans for years and will always be remembered for all the great things he brought. The time for a replacement is now, so get busy Liverpool and get his replacement sorted quickly. Alex:No need to look further thanFulham'sAntonee Robinson. He has skill, pace and has come of age with consistent game time. He is what Robbo used to be in his younger years - a class act. Conor Bradley and Robinson at each side? I'll take it every day of the week and twice on Sundays. Vardon:Condemning Robertson after a single high-profile mistake, then consigning him to second string in place of an unknown quantity as his replacement is a huge overreaction. Given FSG's record in the transfer market, there is zero chance of a high-profile replacement being signed in January. More quality in defensive midfield would have prevented that through ball as it split us wide open at the back. That is the priority in January, not a left back. Sharon:Robbo was the player of the match before that in Europe. He needs a rest, but let's not throw him on the scrap heap. Jahan:While it is good to have multiple options at every position, to demote Robertson to the ranks of the expendables is too harsh and unnecessary. All players go through highs and lows and Andy is no exception. He can easily continue through his contract and an appropriate decision must be taken when the time comes. Now is not the time."
3/17/2025,15:56,'I'm calm... but there is a limit',"Liverpool head coach Arne Slot says he is calm on the touchline but certain refereeing decisions can make him become ""emotional"". Slot will watch the Reds playSouthamptonin the Carabao Cup quarter-final on Wednesday from the stands for the first time in his career, as he serves his touchline ban for accumulating three yellow cards so far this season. ""In general, I'm calm,"" said the Dutchman. ""But there is also a limit for me and then I can get emotional. ""Unfortunately, that limit is reached more by refereeing decisions than the decisions my players make!"" This video can not be played "
3/17/2025,13:19,'Slot needs a younger left-back',"Liverpool need a new left-back. We already knew this before the 2-2 draw withFulham, but that match confirmed it. Andy Robertson has been incredible for Liverpool. An absolute bargain and an icon under Jurgen Klopp, but he is past his best and Arne Slot needs a younger left-back with more speed and creativity. It is not only that Robbo is less dangerous in the opposition half, it is that he is throwing in costly defensive mistakes. He can be forgiven for Fulham's opener that deflected off him, but the red card was just sloppy and ultimately cost us three points. Liverpool were dominant with 10 men so you can only assume we would have won the game with 11. Kostas Tsimikas is a decent back-up, but his performances have been better than Robbo's this season. The reality is we probably only need one of Robertson or Tsimikas going forward, to play the back-up role. We need to sign a starter - perhaps as early as January. Milos Kerkez fromBournemouthis a potentially superb option. The Hungarian is well known to director of football Richard Hughes, who actually brought him to England when he was working for the Cherries in 2023. Arne Slot was not backed in the summer, so with Liverpool competing in both the Premier League and Champions League, hopefully the board can strengthen his position by entering the transfer market in January.

3/17/2025,09:47,"Slot on team news, touchline ban and squad rotation","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Wednesday's Carabao Cup quarter-final atSouthampton(kick-off 20:00 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Kostas Tsimikas will train with the team on Tuesday and then a decision will be made. Fellow defenders Ibrahima Konate and Conor Bradley remained sidelined as they have not yet returned to group training. Slot ""does not expect Diogo Jota to start"" against Southampton as he ""wasn't completely fit"" after finishing the game againstFulhamand he missed Monday's training session as a consequence. Federico Chiesa will have the opportunity to build-up his minutes, but ""the amount has a question mark over"" because he has been out injured for so long. Caoimhin Kelleher will start in goal, with Slot adding: ""We are really fortunate to have such a great second goalkeeper."" On serving a touchline ban for the cup game: ""If you are suspended in Holland then you are not allowed to be in and around the dressing room. You cannot do the media as well. This is a lighter version of suspension. I have never been used to being suspended. This is the first time I am. I think I am still able to do the things I want to do."" He said he did not deserve one of the three yellow cards he has received, but joked: ""The one againstChelseawas absolutely deserved and in that same game I could have got five, so I have to thank the referee that I only got one."" On opponents Southampton, who will have Simon Rusk in interim charge after the sacking of Russell Martin on Sunday: ""It is difficult to know what to expect. I saw them play at the weekend with four at the back and they changed to five in 15 minutes."" He said the Carabao Cup has ""great teams"" left in it and ""none of them will be an easy road to the final"". On Wataru Endo: ""That is the positive for me about the League Cup. We haven't played many starters yet. Endo hasn't played that much yet. Playing in the League Cup helps him get rhythm."" He said he ""is aware that they only have four defenders available"" because of Andy Robertson's suspension, adding: ""It will be either academy players getting playing time or players no-one expects.""

3/17/2025,12:53,'Jota is Liverpool's most clinical finisher',"BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty has been answering fan questions on all things Premier League. Kev asked:How worried should Liverpool be about their reliance on Mohamed Salah's goals and assists. First time in years with so few players up for top goalscorer and assists. Phil answered:All the best teams still rely on their great players, so I don't think Liverpool will be too worried, especially with Cody Gakpo in a rich vein of scoring form. We also saw a very significant development on Saturday with the goalscoring return of Diogo Jota againstFulham. There is actually a case to be made that he is Liverpool's most clinical finisher. If they can keep him fit then he is a huge weapon in their attacking armoury."
3/17/2025,11:02,Liverpool 2-2 Fulham - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts afterSaturday's Premier League gamebetween Liverpool and Fulham. Here are some of your comments: Liverpool fans: Kevin:Gutsy Liverpool display, really dug in and put in a performance that shows exactly why they are the runaway Premier League leaders. Fulham have really performed well this season and ran Liverpool close, in a game where either side could have left Anfield with the three points. James:Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson have been outstanding for us in previous years. However, it seems Trent doesn't want to be here anymore and unfortunately Robbo is starting to lose his edge and is becoming a liability. It's such a shame as, at one time, these two were the pinnacle of our success. Carl:75+ minutes with 10 men was a gutsy performance. The result was entirely down to the referee - he couldn't wait to book Liverpool players for minor fouls but the really big calls all went to Fulham. Issa Diop's foul on Robertson, and studs on the achilles of Ryan Gravenberch (an identical foul was a red card in mid-week). Robertson's foul was due to his injury from Diop. Fulham's time-wasting not addressed by ref. Fraser:Seeing as we were playing with 10 men for almost the entire game, I'll take a point. However our defenders were pretty poor today, (with the exception of Virgil van Dijk). Lack of effort from Trent, Robbo is sadly not the same and Jarell Quansah is just lacking in confidence. Ibrahima Konate's absence is definitely present now. On the bright side, so glad to have Diogo Jota back - we missed him enormously. Fulham fans: Bob:Absolutely brilliant by Fulham! Ten-man Liverpool did enough to grab a point, which they deserved. Our defending for the most part was outstanding! Who would have said 2-2 before the game had been played. Emile Smith Rowe and Rodrigo Muniz should have started. Still, a well deserved point for Fulham. Mario:Happy but unhappy at the same time. When they went down to 10 men, I think we all thought we could go on and solidify our lead, but this was Liverpool and we all know how they can get back into games. Having said that, another point from a fixture we all probably thought we would lose is great. Peter:Fulham displayed heart and courage and fought to the end though were likely still a little too respectful at Anfield with a man advantage. Antonee Robinson was spectacular. Easily man of the match for Fulham. Simon:We're having a great season and are lucky to have a number of players such as Alex Iwobi, Bernd Leno, Diop, Sasa Lukic and Kenny Tete who are playing the best football of their careers. Chief among them is Robinson. The left-back and captain was unplayable at times yesterday. Two assists and Mohamed Salah won't have faced a more difficult opponent all season. As a team though, if only we could take more of our chances."
3/17/2025,10:51,'Brave' approach was 'right' - Van Dijk,"Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk the boss Arne Slot was ""brave"" and ""right"" to demand the team play with risk despite being down to 10 men from the early stages of Saturday's draw with Fulham Andy Robertson was dismissed after just 17 minutes with the score 1-0 to the Cottagers but the Reds still had 61% possession and recorded 16 shots as they came from behind twice to earn a point. ""There was so much time left on the clock and we have the quality to punish opponents,"" Van Dijk said post-match. ""Obviously it was a lot more difficult than it already was but we have to keep going. ""We tried everything. We could have taken all three points if I'm completely honest but it is what it is. Now we have to focus on Wednesday. ""The will to keep going and the resilience was a good sign. We had to take a little bit of risks to get the result so at times the pitch was wide open. ""It was always going to be a tough game but with 10 men it was even more of a tough game and we move on and focus on the next one. ""We don't want to be in a situation where you take that much risk but if you're 1-0 or 2-1 down you have to. It's a brave thing to do but I think it was the right thing to do because we have the quality to hurt opponents even with 10 men. It's still a little bit of a risk but he got the reward for it."" Listen to the full chat on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,08:21,A word on Fulham and a 'bright spot' for Slot,"Everyone will obviously want to talk about Liverpool, but a word for Fulham. Their defensive organisation held title challengersArsenallast week, and a week later they did the same at the home of the league leaders. They've only won twice in 38 away games at Anfield and I'm sure they believed after going ahead for the second time, they could leave with a win. Antonee Robinson was outstanding. All of Fulham's threat came down the left and it was two quality balls from Robinson that led to their goals. His work rate in defence was equally good and he pressed Salah hard in defence as the Fulham defence as a whole held strong. For Liverpool, I wonder how they will feel on Monday about this point. They showed guts and determination to bounce back from going a player down early after Andy Robertson's red card. They showed resilience too as they twice came from behind. A note on the impact of Diogo Jota, who came on as a sub in the second half. Despite the injury, he looked sharp and was able to find the quality to cut through that stubborn Fulham defence. That no doubt will be a big bright spot for Slot."

3/17/2025,17:55,Liverpool 2-2 Fulham: Leaders show title fight,"A goal and a player down after 17 minutes, Liverpool's rivals were beginning to get excited that Arne Slot's lightning-fast start at Anfield was beginning to slow start. When the full-time whistle blew after 100 minutes of high-octane action, there was no doubting the Reds' readiness to fight for the title this season. Yes, Slot's side dropped points for only the fourth game in the Premier League this season. But that there was any hint of disappointment at Anfield after the hosts twice equalised against Fulham with 10-men spoke volumes of the character they showed after Andy Robertson's early red card. Liverpool are now unbeaten in 19 matches in all competitions since their sole loss this season against Nottingham Forest on 14 September - and the return of Diogo Jota and Federico Chiesa to the squad provided an ominous demonstration of their firepower for the busy festive period ahead. With their hard-earned point in the face of adversity not capitalised on by Arsenal, it falls to in-form Chelsea - now five points behind - to attempt to apply pressure when they host Brentford on Sunday."
3/17/2025,17:50,'I don't think I could've asked for more from my players',"Liverpool boss Arne Slot speaking to Sky Sports after today's game:""I don't think I could've asked for more from my players, especially after going down to 10 men. I couldn't have asked for more in terms of performance and results. of course, we could have had two points more. At the start of the game, you always want to start intense. After 30 seconds, one of ours was on the floor and needed treatment for a while so we couldn't get the intensity more. On the red card:""I think Robbo might have been a bit too injured to keep going because normally he's faster than that. It says a lot about his character that he wants to keep on going but it results in a red card. I think it's just whether it's offside. I was clear it wasn't going to be changed. It's maybe the only thing I didn't complain about today. It's an emotional game and we were a man down, it's frustrating. It's good to see our performance after so many setbacks. ""It's difficult to judge for me because I only see it in real-time like the referee. We have to accept what VAR sees. You know how important these decisions can be. We ended up with a draw and I don't think we can blame the referee for that. There were a few moments when I could have been given a yellow card. It's marginal moments and when some go against you, you think some will go for you but I haven't felt that here. There was a moment when one of their players already on a yellow could have been given another."""
3/17/2025,17:29,Liverpool 2-2 Fulham: Did you know?,"Since the start of last season, Fulham's Antonee Robinson has assisted 11 Premier League goals – the most of any defender. Since his Premier League debut for Liverpool in September 2020, no player has more goals as a substitute in the competition than Diogo Jota (8)."
3/17/2025,17:18,'We felt the referee was nervous',"Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk speaking to Sky Sports after today's draw:""A great comeback is very positive. It's disappointing having 10 men but we showed fight, kept trying to create chances. Could have been more but we take the point and move on. On what the players needed to do when losing:""Stay calm. It's easier to say than do it. It was always going to be tough against them. We saw it last year and last week againstArsenal. We had to turn it around and keep fighting. We tried."" On the red card:""I had conversations with the players ofFulhamand we felt like the referee was nervous. He couldn't properly communicate with Robertson I felt. We can't put the blame on the referee. We all speak about protecting the referee but I couldn't speak to him. It shouldn't be a big thing because he isn't why we dropped points. ""It is what it is. We take the points, recover quickly and be ready for the game on Wednesday."""

3/17/2025,11:07,Sutton's predictions: Liverpool v Fulham,"Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests. For week 16 he takes on darts star Stephen Bunting, who is a Liverpoolfan. Bunting, who is ranked eighth in the Professional Darts Championship (PDC) order of merit, takes on Alan Soutar or Kai Gotthardt in the second round of the PDC World Championship, which starts at London's Alexandra Palace on Sunday. Sutton's prediction: 3-0 I am covering this game for BBC Radio 5 Live and it will be interesting to see what Fulham do. They were very well-organised defensively againstArsenallast time out, and were happy to sit in and try to carry a threat on the counter. That probably did not work as effectively as they would have liked, other than when Raul Jimenez put them ahead, but I suspect they will go with a similar gameplan at Anfield. So, Adama Traore will start again, along with Alex Iwobi who had a good game against the Gunners, with Sander Berge and Sasa Lukic together in a more defensively minded midfield. They didn't keep Arsenal out, though, and I can't see them stopping Liverpool either. Arne Slot's side were quite flat in their midweek win over Girona. He was quite critical of their performance but I think a lot of teams are going through a period where they are so stretched by the Premier League and Champions League. The first goal is going to be important here, but I expect Liverpool to get it and then go on to win comfortably. Bunting's prediction: 2-1 Fulham are a decent side. We will win, but they are going to score. 2-1. Read the full predictions and have your say here"
3/17/2025,18:03,Slot impressed by Chelsea quality,"One of the most interesting segments from Arne Slot's pre-Fulham news conference on Friday was hearing his thoughts on Liverpool's current closest rivalsChelsea. The Blues are second in the Premier League - four points behind Liverpool having played a game more - but their boss Enzo Maresca has consistently played down his side's title chances. Liverpool beat Chelsea 2-1 at Anfield in October and Slot cited that game as proof of the quality Maresca's players possess. ""It was one of the games, maybe the only game, where I felt the other team was better than us,"" said Slot. ""That's not to say for the long term they are better than us but during the game they had more ball possession than us and were threatening us more than any other team until now. ""I'm not there to judge which position they will end in the league table. I have to focus on my own team but Chelsea have been impressive this season so far, that's for sure."" In his conversation with the media, he addressed a number of other issues before welcoming Fulham to Anfield on Saturday (15:00 GMT). He defended Darwin Nunez given the striker's current struggles for goals. He also said he was not worried that Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk could speak to foreign clubs from 1 January with their deals expiring in the summer. Finally he added that forwards Diogo Jota and Federico Chiesa could be in the squad to faceFulham."
3/17/2025,17:20,Is Nunez low on confidence?,"Liverpool fan Jim Boardman says Darwin Nunez ""could be lacking confidence"" and that is why he is struggling to put away chances this season. Earlier on Friday, head coach Arne Slot defended the forward and says he does not judge him on just his goals tally but rather his impact on the all-round game. Nunez has been getting stuck in defensively, but Boardman worries how much longer you can rely on that. ""Eventually, it could get to a point where you think that is something you can teach another striker if his instinct isn't there,"" he said on BBC Radio Merseyside. ""He is still young and still learning, so could also be lacking confidence. We see this in strikers - that once they have a couple of goals the confidence comes back. ""The problem is that he might not get that chance if Diogo Jota comes back from injury. Plus, playing in the middle doesn't seem to suit him and he seems to play better as a wide player. ""He is running out of time. I am sure he has got until the end of the season to see how he goes, but if Liverpool can buy well in the summer then he might not be here. ""They paid quite a bit for him so they may have to take a hit on the fee."" Listen to the full discussion on BBC Sounds"

3/17/2025,09:57,"Slot on Jota return, Nunez's frustrations and Fulham","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game at home toFulham(kick-off 15:00 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Federico Chiesa and Diogo Jota are available, with the latter ""maybe in the squad"". Slot conceded Chiesa ""needs playing time"" but after missing months with injury ""it is difficult for a manager to give him his first minutes because you don't know what you're going to get."" Slot added that the Carabao Cup trip toSouthamptonnext Wednesday may be a more suitable option. He is hopeful that the amount of time Alisson needed to get back to his best level will help Liverpool's number one stay available for the long term. On the Brazil keeper's importance against Girona this week in the Champions League: ""If we hadn't conceded the amount of chances we did, then I would have had more positives about it. We relied on our goalkeeper. A few positives were the amount of shots we blocked and there was better defending in moments than againstNewcastle."" He said he had expected his side to look refreshed in that game after not playing last weekend, so ""it was a surprise"" that the players looked more lethargic. Slot added: ""Maybe it's a good thing that we play so many games."" On the impact of travel in the Champions League: ""It's what the players are used to and we have a big squad. Sometimes it's even nice to go somewhere different and get a bit of sun. Although there was none in the week! You don't complain about the amount of travel you have to do. We are privileged that we travel in a very good way. I hope we get to travel more in the second part of the season!"" On Darwin Nunez's frustrations with his goal tally: ""He hasn't scored the amount of goals he wants to, or that we want him to. But he does have an impact as he is aggressive off the ball. He is part of a team that scores a lot of goals and who are winning a lot. Of course, he wants to score more goals. I'm not only judging on goals, it is on the work rate and what they bring to the team and that has been positive up until now."" On opponents Fulham, who have avoided defeat against high-flyingArsenalandBrighton: ""You can only take points if you have a good game plan. They work really hard when they don't have the ball and this is why they don't concede many goals. They are well organised and structured, and they are always a threat on the counter-attack."" Finally, Slot said it does nt worry him that Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Trent Alexander-Arnold will be able to talk to international clubs in coming weeks.

3/17/2025,08:23,Slot will expect improvement from Girona win,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot appears to be able to do no wrong at the moment. The Reds did not even play in the Premier League last week but had a good weekend as two of their three closest rivals slipped up. Arsenal, who drew 1-1 withFulham, andManchester City, who were held 1-1 byCrystal Palace, both dropped points after Slot's side had their derby atEvertonpostponed because of adverse weather conditions. The only title rival to win wereChelseawho beatTottenhamto move second in the Premier League and four points behind the Reds. Liverpool also remain top of the Champions League group in its new format as they achieved a sixth win out of six games with a 1-0 victory at Girona. However, while Slot has come across as being calm, composed and measured so far, some frustration came to the surface in the wake of Tuesday's match in Spain. Despite the Reds maintaining their 100% record in Europe this season, Slot was ""far from pleased"" with a performance in which his side did not have the control he demands and afforded Girona a number of chances. Slot will want to make sure there is no repeat when Liverpool host Fulham in the league on Saturday and he will be speaking to the media at 09:15 GMT today in the build up to that game. Darwin Nunez has one goal in 10 outings and we will hear if Slot has anything to say about the Uruguay striker's struggles. Diogo Jota and Federico Chiesa have been back in training and we should also get an update on their availability."

3/17/2025,19:50,'Are we witnessing the formation of some worrying fault lines?',"Liverpool kept their 100% Champions League record intact with a 1-0 win at Girona on Tuesday. Despite the victory, Arne Slot was distinctly underwhelmed by the performance. The Reds boss was not enamoured by the time and space given to the opposition and how dysfunctional Liverpool's press proved to be. Given the match in Spain followed a sub-standard first 45 minutes atNewcastlea week ago, are we witnessing the formation of some worrying fault lines leaving the team exposed defensively? Slot will highlight these shortcomings to the squad and make it clear that, if the deficiencies are not addressed, there will be a price to pay. However, it is worth noting that after six wins in Europe so far and a top-eight finish all-but guaranteed, there are still plenty of reasons to accentuate the positives. Finding a way to win when your footballing standards dip is still an admirable quality, and Liverpool have it in abundance. It is a squad full of richly talented players with the desire and dedication to keep making things happen. Slot will want to make sure those qualities are visible in the midst of a hectic fixture schedule that continues with Saturday's againstFulhamat Anfield. Marco Silva has done an excellent job at Craven Cottage. Not only getting them back into the Premier League, but by also putting together a team that has progressed year on year and have the capability to provide a stern test for the top teams. The introduction of Emile Smith Rowe has brought more invention to their attack and Alex Iwobi is in the most productive form of his Fulham career so far. Liverpool go into the match with a four-point lead at the top of the table, and a game in hand over nearest challengersChelsea. They also have goalkeeper Alisson back after an extended injury absence. Caoimhin Kelleher proved to be a superb deputy but the Reds number one keeper once again proved his value against Girona with a series of formidable saves. Slot rates him as the best goalkeeper in the world and, after an incredible start to his Liverpool managerial career, he is clearly a man worth listening to.

3/17/2025,19:21,Nunez staying 'resilient',"Liverpool forward Darwin Nunez has seemingly responded to criticism of his form this season in posts on social media. The Uruguayan struggled to make an impact once again in the Champions League on Tuesday as Liverpool battled to a 1-0 win at Girona. Team-mate Mohamed Salah scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot. Nunez as scored three goals in 19 matches so far in 2024-25. In a post on Instagram, he wrote: ""They are not all, they are some. Thank you, Reds, for your support. We are all still together."" He followed that by uploading an image of himself in-game with the word ""resiliencia"", which translates as resilience. The 25-year-old arrived at Anfield for an initial £64m in summer 2022."
3/17/2025,14:55,Is Nunez going backwards?,"Hidden beneath the surface of Arne Slot's trouble-free start to life as Liverpool boss is one gnarly issue. What to do with Darwin Nunez. The Uruguay forward has only three goals in 19 appearances so far this season – and Reds fans have told us earlier on this page how ""out of sorts"" he looked as some more chances went begging at Girona on Tuesday. Afterwards Slot defended Nunez: ""I can agree he missed quite a few chances [but] I think every striker all around the world has periods where every ball goes in, and sometimes he has a period when you try so hard but you're not able to score."" This is not new territory for Nunez. Now into his third year at Anfield, and presumably entering his prime at 25 years old, thesigning from Benfica - who cost an initial £64m- arguably ought to be a firm fixture in the starting XI. Instead, he is on the fringes, starting only half of Liverpool's games so far this season. So is he going backwards - or is his position just unavoidable collateral in an historically good start to the season? Not a Liverpool fan? Find your Premier League club's page here The 2023-24 season was fruitful for Nunez. Eighteen goals and 13 assists was an excellent return for a player who had blown hot and cold in his debut campaign. Initially dubbed an ""agent of chaos"", he seemed to have added end product to his wildcard tendencies up front. He particularly impressed over winter last season, bagging five goals in a run of six wins in seven Premier League games from 26 December. However, the seeds of his fall from the team were sown in the final weeks of Jurgen Klopp's reign, starting just one of the final eight games. That trend has continued – but have his stats dipped as well? Maybe it is unfair to draw too many conclusions. After all, Nunez has only had 30 shots in total this season - and a 10% conversion rate is in line with previous years. What is clear, though, is that he is far from a guaranteed starter in Slot's side and will continue to divide opinion among Liverpool fans. A fit and firing Nunez would surely be a huge boost to the Reds as they fight on four fronts for silverware. But then again, so would a similar Diogo Jota, who may well walk straight back into the side when he returns."
3/17/2025,08:03,Girona 0-1 Liverpool - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts afterTuesday's Champions League gamebetween Girona and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Shay:Can't help but feel we are getting away with some games right now away from home. We could have lost atNewcastleand had no control against Girona, as Arne Slot said post-match. Our slow starts and first-half performances will come back to bite us later on in the season. While Slot has bought more calm and defensive solidity, we are far too reliant on Mohamed Salah and I am struggling to see many other assist or goalscorers in the team! Scudgie:Not our best display, but how lucky are we to have both Alisson and Caiomhin Kelleher? Darwin Nunez really looked out of sorts tonight - his head dropped after missing those chances. Hope Slot puts an arm around him because he's vital to our ambitions this season. Steve:A hard fought encounter but I'll take results over performance. My only concern is Nunez. Another poor performance and my support for him is waning.  Strikers are judged on goals and he isn't delivering. Sam:Thought we were very poor again. The penalty saved us from what should have been a much more convincing win. Not often I look at my phone more than the game, but I did during that game. Need to step up a level or two in the next few games or the likes ofChelseawill overtake us at the top. Kev:A lucky penalty but I'm sure we will happily take a win however it comes! Very disappointed with Nunez's performance again, Slot surely has had enough of him misfiring."
3/17/2025,07:52,'You can see the effect Alisson has' - Robinson on Liverpool keeper battle,"Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson says Alisson Becker proved why he is ""one of the best in the world"" with his comeback performance against Girona. Alisson's return meant Caoimhin Kelleher returned to the bench after deputising in 11 games this season. ""He is a big-game player and one of the best goalkeepers in the world,"" Robinson told the BBC Radio 5 Live Football Daily podcast. ""It is his all-round game, in terms of making saves and dominating his box, that makes him the best. ""He can do the modern-day bit which is distribution with his feet, but he has not forgotten that the main art of a goalkeeper is to keep the ball out of the net. ""It is tough on Kelleher because he always does extremely well when he comes in  and he would play at a lot of other clubs. But when you've got one of the world's best in Alisson, you can see the effect he has on games. ""Top clubs often have two goalkeepers and it takes a different mental strength to know your second choice. I think it is time for Kelleher to go and play first-team football.

3/17/2025,23:40,Girona 0-1 Liverpool: Slot's Reds find a way to win - again,"Liverpool have got that habit that all successful teams have: they know how to find a way to win. Tuesday's 1-0 victory at Gironawas by no means a standout performance from Arne Slot's team but the current Champions League and Premier League leaders are getting over the line at crucial moments in both competitions at present. In truth, the narrow win in Catalonia looked like it could end in stalemate - even if Liverpool marginally edged proceedings - before Luis Diaz won the penalty that would ultimately decide the contest. The referee had initially waved away the Colombian's protests but, following a VAR review, former Manchester United midfielder Donny van de Beek was adjudged to have fouled the winger. Once again, talisman Mohamed Salah stepped up and converted from the spot,  earning Slot's side a valuable three points that now has them on the verge of the knockout stages before any other club. Whether it was coming back from a goal down to beatBrightonor recovering from a two-goal deficit to win 3-2 atSouthampton, Liverpool are showing a never-say-die attitude thathas many tipping them for success across the board in 2024-25. While Slot was ""far from pleased"" with his team's performance, the Dutchman can certainly not knock the Reds' current knack of simply finding a way to win."
3/17/2025,21:34,'I am far from pleased about the performance' - Slot,"Liverpool boss Arne Slot, speaking to the media after the Reds' 1-0 win at Girona: ""If you ask me about all the six games, I'm really pleased with all the results. ""I'm really pleased with the five games, the way we played. I am far from pleased about the performance tonight."" On what had made him so unhappy:""A lot. Especially two things. ""If you play against a team who has such a good idea about football and know how to bring the ball out from the back like some other teams we faced recently, like [Manchester] City or Real Madrid, then you have to be so intense if you want to make it difficult for them. ""But if every time you are waiting a few seconds and then if you do press, you are so easily out-played as this team can cause you problems and this is what they showed during the whole Champions League campaign, except for PSV Eindhoven away. ""I almost feel sorry for them because they deserve so much more in this campaign than the three points they have now. ""And every time we lost the ball we were not aggressive enough, almost every time they just went all the way to our goal. ""We had hardly any control in the game. Maybe the second half was better - I'm trying to be positive."" On goalkeeper Alisson's return after injury:""We have an incredible goalkeeper. I said as a joke, maybe the players wanted to see how fit he was to give him so much work. ""He showed today he is probably one of the best, in my opinion, the best goalkeeper in the world. ""Let's hope he can continue to keep bringing these performances and hope more he can stay fit."""
3/17/2025,20:33,'Liverpool for anyone will be a very tough game this season',"Liverpool ""got the job done"" in their win away to Girona and will be a ""very tough game"" for anyone they face this season, says former defender Stephen Warnock. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live after the Reds' 1-0 victory in the Champions League on Tuesday evening that kept their perfect record in the competition this campaign, Warnock said: ""Not Liverpool's greatest performance but it is a job well done. ""They were a little bit fortuitous with the penalty but the same result as usual for Mohamed Salah. He missed against Real Madrid a couple of weeks back but came back and made sure he got it and they get the three points. ""Liverpool weren't at their best but they got the job done and that is the main thing. ""Not much was expected this year of Liverpool, but in the changing room there would have been a lot of people saying, 'no, we can go on a good run, we can be dominant in both competitions'. ""Would they have thought it would have been to this degree? I'm not so sure.

3/17/2025,12:27,Reds rest at an ideal time,"He will not say it, but you can bet Arne Slot was quite happy when Storm Darragh led to the postponement of the Merseyside derby on Saturday. Liverpool, for the first time all season, looked tired againstNewcastleand like injuries were taking their toll. Joe Gomez and Jarell Quansah played alongside each other at right-back and centre-back, but were a pale imitation of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ibrahima Konate. Ryan Gravenberch looked leggy at number six and was withdrawn early, while Caoimhin Kelleher made his first meaningful mistake of the season to cost the Reds two points. Just a few days later, they would have had to play in horrendous conditions at 12:30 GMT, away to their local rivalsEverton. But the postponement has allowed Slot's team a proper rest, while our lethargic rivalsArsenalandManchester Citydropped points. It would have been a clean sweep ifTottenhamhad not imploded againstChelsea, too. Slot can also rotate versus Girona midweek, with Liverpool virtually assured top-eight qualification in the Champions League, giving his best players 10 days between the Newcastle game andFulhamon Saturday. It could not have come at a better time, especially with Alisson and Diogo Jota both now back in team training, plus Federico Chiesa playing minutes for the under-21s and ready to compete for a place too.

3/17/2025,09:30,Which goalkeeper leaves in the summer?,"The New York Times' chief soccer correspondent, Rory Smith, believes it is possible that Liverpool will part ways with goalkeeper Alisson at the end of this season and keep Caoimhin Kelleher instead. Number two Kelleher has impressed in Alisson's recent absence, but with the Reds also buying Giorgi Mamardashvili in the summer it would suggest one is set to leave. But who could that be? ""It's possible that Alisson is the goalkeeper that leaves Liverpool in the summer,"" said Smith on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club. ""I don't have any reason to believe it will be, but I don't think it would be ridiculous if Liverpool think Kelleher has everything needed to succeed him. ""Mamardashvili looks like he's also an outstanding prospect, so maybe for a year they'll do that awkward thing thatArsenaldid with David Raya and Aaron Ramsdale  - where you have two and you have competition between them to establish who's going to be number one. ""But I don't think it's impossible that Liverpool will look at Alisson's injury record, and the fact he's on a lot of money, and they'll think maybe it's time for him to earn that money elsewhere.""

Here are the key lines from his news conference: Slot confirmed that Alisson, who was included in the travelling squad on Monday, is fit to face the Spanish side. The Liverpool boss said it ""speaks for itself"" having the ""outstanding"" number one back available, adding: ""But, if you look at how his replacement did, it is difficult to do even better. We expect some margins may be better, but Kelleher did so well we can say we have two very good goalkeepers who can do the job well."" Slot is unsure if finishing top of the Champions League table will be helpful for the next round, but says they have always played their starters as you ""need results to finish in the highest possible position to skip the play-off round"". Slot added: ""In the end, if it means by playing your starters always and skipping that next round then still having a difficult draw, maybe then we are going to think about it differently next season in the group stage. But we have to wait and see. First of all, we want to stay in the top eight and we think we still need one win."" On the temptation to rotate players or whether the postponed game on Saturday has helped: ""If we had played that game then we would have still played the same team tomorrow night, but you don't know what that fixture would have led too. Very good choice to cancel the game for the safety of people and if you want a special last game at Goodison Park then you need good circumstances. Everyone is really fit because we skip that game so no reason to rotate."" On the advantage of missing a play-off round when Premier League sides Arsenal and Manchester City may have to play one: ""If we end up in the top, I imagine they will as well. Arsenal 95%, City need a bit more, but they are able to win three times in a row as well. I don't know if it is an advantage. We have played nearly every three days and not done that bad."" He jokingly added: ""Maybe we should implement friendly games [for the play-off time] if we do finish in the top eight."" Slot believes it is ""really special"" what Girona have done in the past few years and said they were ""close to becoming like Leicester City of England a couple of years ago, competing for title"". He continued: ""With this budget it shows how good the manager is. This season they still do better than results might look."""

But he has been excellent for them while Alisson has been out injured and I don't think a draw at St James' Park is a bad result. Everton come into this game in better form following their win overWolves, which was a huge result for Toffees boss Sean Dyche after the run they were on. They can definitely make things difficult for Liverpool, and I suspect they will be fairly direct when they attack, but Arne Slot's side should have too much quality for them.

3/17/2025,17:24,Where would they be without him?,"It seems like each night brings a social media rumour over Mohamed Salah's contract situation as eager fans share snippets of gossip about the saga being over. The wait goes on as Liverpool prepare for Saturday's meeting with local rivalsEverton. The Toffees have done a decent job of taming Salah, who has found the net seven times in fixtures against them. That's less than he has against the likes ofManchester City(eight),Arsenal(11) andManchester United(12). This season, though, he has raced away from team-mates - scoring 13 times and assisting on eight occasions for a total of 21 direct goal involvements. The nearest player to him for the Reds is Luis Diaz, on a combined seven. Where would they be without him? Liverpool fans will hope they don't need to find the answer to that question any time soon."
3/17/2025,14:08,"Slot on his first derby, Kelleher and being 'smart'","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game againstEverton(kick-off 12:30 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: No injured players will recover in time for the Merseyside derby, with Alisson the closest to making his return. Slot said the derby ""is going to be special for everyone"", adding: ""It being the last one at Goodison [Park] makes it even more special."" On what he expects from his first one: ""It's only a nice experience if the result goes your way. We know we have to be ready against a tough team. The fans will be loud. We have to be prepared for everything in this game."" He wants his team ""to be aggressive in a smart way"" because having watched last season's game back, Liverpool gave away too many fouls considering the possession stats. He said Everton are ""a big threat from set pieces,"" so ""unnecessary free kicks"" will not help his side get a result. On Caoimhin Kelleher, who was at fault forNewcastle'sequaliser on Wednesday: ""If you make a mistake as a goalkeeper it's difficult for someone else to cover it up for you. He's always there to help us. We just unfortunately couldn't be there to help him."" More on Liverpool's number two: ""He's in a good place, although he's disappointed like the others for dropping points from a winning situation. He can go into this game with a lot of confidence."" On whether he is thinking about the high winds that are expected on Merseyside: ""Not at the moment but you have to take it into consideration. Not in the line-up but in the execution of the players. It can have an influence."" Alexis Mac Allister is suspended for this match but Slot is confident they have enough available players to fill in. Slot added: ""You know throughout the season this will happen but it is always in these moments when you feel like 'oh we could have used him in this one!'"" On Jarell Quansah's performance at right-back on Wednesday: ""Quansah played quite a good game. From what I'm told not everyone agrees with me on that. But in his one v ones he had no problems."" Slot said Conor Bradley is a similar type to Trent Alexander-Arnold, in that ""he tries to attack the goal and make the overlaps"", whereas Quansah ""is more behind the ball"".

3/17/2025,10:55,Can Liverpool stop Everton damaging title challenge?,"The big games keep coming for Premier League leaders Liverpool and head coach Arne Slot. Following wins over Real Madrid andManchester Citybefore a thrilling draw atNewcastle United, the Reds now face a short trip to face local rivalsEvertonon Saturday (12:30 GMT). It will be Slot's first derby but is set to be the last one in the league at Goodison Park before Everton's planned move to their new stadium for next season. The blue side of Merseyside will want to make it a game to remember by damaging Liverpool's title challenge, while the Reds will want to get back to winning ways to keep the chasing pack at arm's length. Slot is due to speaking to the media at about 13:15 GMT and it will be interesting to hear what he has got to say about where his side are at. They had a poor first half at St James' Park on Wednesday so are the strains of the season starting to show? Joe Gomez and Jarell Quansah started in defence at Newcastle as the injuries have  started to pile up for the Reds, with centre-back Ibrahima Konate, right-back Conor Bradley and left-back Kostas Tsimikas out for a few weeks. Keeper Alisson, forward Diogo Jota and winger Federico Chiesa have been out for a while and we'll find out where they are at on the road to their return. Slot gives very little away when asked about the futures of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk, who are out of contract at the end of the season, and expect the same if he is questioned again on the issue.

3/17/2025,09:43,'Diabolical' mistakes and is Nunez good enough?,"Liverpool fan Peter Bolster speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside on Caoimhín Kelleher's mistake in the 3-3 draw at Newcastle:""It was just diabolical. Inexcusable by the keeper. You cannot defend that type of decision making. As well as he has done coming in over the last few months and in cup competitions over the last few seasons, when you're playing at the highest level, you have to do the right thing. Just to leave it was disgraceful. ""He's done it before. I think it was the Villa game where he left it and got away with it. There is patterns in his play. ""This is not knee-jerk. He's a number two keeper who has come in and done very well. It has to end the debate about bringing Alisson back in. ""It was the nature of the mistake and the fact it has happened before. ""Is it a point gained? The reason we were so happy to go 11 clear of City and nine of Arsenal was to have an off night like that. It was the midweek game, the tricky game."" Some fans contacted BBC Radio Merseyside about the form of Darwin Nunez and Bolster commented:""He was shocking. I think his all-round game. When I was a kid Michael Owen came back for five or six games and hadn't scored and it was a headline. Why doesn't no one talk about Nunez? He has two Premier League goals this season, three in 18 in all competitions. It's simply not good enough for a Liverpool striker. ""He's 25, not a young lad. So when we talk about a young player with attributes to refine, it's simply not true. He gave the ball away over and over again. If he didn't he passed behind players and slowed counter-attacks down. He is not a good enough footballer for a top side, simple as that."" Listen to more of the debate on BBC Radio Merseyside"
3/17/2025,09:23,Did you know?,"This is Arne Slot's first meeting withEvertonas Liverpool manager. Only one Reds boss has won their first ever league Merseyside derby when that match has come away from home, with Kenny Dalglish overseeing a 3-2 victory in September 1985."
3/17/2025,09:22,Liverpool's superstitious side,"Ray Houghton has been speaking about the superstitions at Liverpool during his time at Anfield - and the time he was stitched up by his team-mates to sit in manager Kenny Dalglish's chair before his first game for the club. On the latest episode of the BBC's Sacked in the Morning podcast, Houghton said: ""When you were getting a bus for away games, you sat in the same seats. ""It was virtually the same teams every day in training - you couldn't change over. ""Even your meal on a Friday night, it was really basic. There's only three meals you could have, there was fish and chips and spaghetti, but you couldn't say 'no, I want X, Y and Z' - nothing like that."" Houghton played more than 150 games for Liverpool between 1987 and 1992, but he might not have made an appearance for the club at all after upsetting Dalglish during the pre-match meal before his first game. ""I didn't know where to sit - it's my first game."" Houghton said. ""So the lads said to me 'go sit in that chair there'. So I sat down and had a sixth sense something was wrong because I could see them giggling and laughing - I thought I'd spilt something down my shirt and tie. ""Then the doors opened and in walked Kenny Dalglish, straight over and went 'you're sitting in my chair, what are you going to do?' And I'm thinking 'what am I going to do?'"" Despite everyone else in the room expecting Houghton to give his seat up for the manager, he stayed where he was. ""I said 'I'm going to sit here'. 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm going to sit here'. ""[Dalglish] went OK, and sat somewhere. I felt ten feet tall. didn't I?"" When it came to picking the team, Dalglish looked across the room pointing at those playing, before focusing on Houghton: ""'Sub, you. Don't ever sit in my chair again. Got it?'"" Thankfully for Houghton, his Liverpool career did not end that day and he helped the club achieve two league titles and two FA Cups in his time with the Reds.

3/17/2025,14:40,Nostalgic night under St James' Park lights,"Wednesday's 3-3 draw between Newcastle and Liverpool provided a lovely feeling of nostalgia for many people watching as it was a game of old. It was a great game and there is always an energy around midweek nights at St James' Park. Newcastle were very much on the front foot in the first half and it was a great goal from Alexander Isak. Liverpool weren't at their absolute best but Arne Slot is really good at tweaking his team at half-time to bring out a better version of them in the second half. Even when Liverpool scored, Newcastle were still pushing forward and then when they equalised the noise level inside the stadium went up again. At 3-2 you probably thought the game was over, so fair play to Newcastle for bouncing back. That came through a mistake by Caoimhin Kelleher, which 99 times out of 100 would not have been punished the way it was. The finish from Fabian Schar is not getting enough credit and it will probably be one of the best finishes of the season. It was just an incredible game and the Newcastle fans will have loved it. From a Liverpool perspective, it probably serves as a bit of a reminder of what is ahead of them this season. They might want to win the Premier League title but there will be hiccups along the way and Wednesday's result was a big boost for those teams around them in the title race. Nedum Onuoha was speaking to BBC Sport's Katie Stafford"
3/17/2025,14:11,'It's about people coming together to help those most in need',"While Saturday's Merseyside derby throws up the usual conflicts between Everton and Liverpool supporters, this weekend's edition holds further significance as fans look to come together to combat food poverty in the city. Saturday's match will be the last Premier League derby at Goodison Park, as Everton's new stadium nears completion, and Katie Carter from fans' group The 1878s spoke to BBC Radio Merseyside on Thursday about how they want to mark the fixture. ""We do the flags at Goodison and we kindly have fans who sponsor our displays,"" she said. ""We decided we always ask people to donate to us to be able to make the flags happen. We decided, why not give something back? How about we try our utmost to make this the biggest collection that the foodbanks have ever had at a football game? ""It's not about Everton or Liverpool, it's about people in the city coming together as we always do to help those most in need. If every single fan that went to the game, if possible, could bring one tin of food or toiletries, there wouldn't be one hungry kid in this city on Saturday night. ""How good would that make you feel, knowing you have been a part of that and helped the people who most need it?"" When people see foodbank donations, the assumption is that food is the only thing those in poverty need. As Katie explains, the problems are rooted deeper than that. ""Things have cropped up this week that we didn't know about,"" she added. ""There are thousands of children on Merseyside who go to school with no deodorant on and haven't been washed. They don't have the products to do that. ""There is so much more than just providing food to people. Let's help these children have better hygiene and stuff like that when they are going to school."""
3/17/2025,11:59,Newcastle 3-3 Liverpool - the fans' verdict,"We asked for your thoughts after Wednesday's Premier League game between Newcastle and Liverpool. Here are some of your comments: Newcastle fans Wardy:Wow. So, yet again we go toe to toe with the best the Premier League has to offer. If we can just maintain this level of intensity and commitment, we will climb the table. No more excuses lads - no fixture congestion, few injuries, everything to play for. Come on!! Simon:What a difference between the team that turned up last night against Liverpool.  To a man every ball was fought for, the press, the number of turnovers and the number of chances created were exceptional. This is by far our best performance of the season. Shoutout for the fans who acted as the 12th Man. A pleasure to watch. James:Two points lost rather than a point gained, however, a better performance. Could've been 3-0 up at half time and they were punished with their mistakes for Liverpool's goals. The lack of conviction in some chances has been the downfall this season so far. Ernie:Really entertaining game. Glad to get a point. Could have been three but for a couple of defensive errors but Liverpool are a dangerous side all over the park. Tonali and Big Joe were excellent. Philippe:Great game. Isak on fire and Gordon more influential on the left. Tonali did very well also. In Howe we trust. How did the referee blow the final whistle when we were three against one? It should have been ours for a last grasp winner for 4-3. Liverpool fans Tim Wadsworth:A point was well deserved against a high press team who were the better team on the night. Would love Isak to be our number nine. A goalkeeper error in the end but how many saves has he made for us so far? Three points a must at Goodison on Saturday. Ruhel:Don't blame Kelleher for the Newcastle Goal. He has saved us on numerous occasions. I blame Nunez for missing chances again. Not good enough for Liverpool. Need to buy a striker in January as Jota is injury prone. Ken Adams:Conceding so late feels more like points dropped than points gained. Have to bounce back at Goodison on Saturday to regain momentum. Won't be easy if the players don't win their individual duels. Quite a few lost composure under pressure and the reaction to a small setback is now vital. Chris:Started off too slow and gave Newcastle momentum. Much better second half, but the Reds have been brilliant so far, and one average performance occasionally to be expected. But a point earned. Get Mo and Virgil signed please. "
3/17/2025,08:46,Salah is 'irreplaceable' - Slot,"This video can not be played  Liverpool boss Arne Slot says Mohamed Salah is ""irreplaceable"". The forward scored two in Wednesday's 3-3 draw at Newcastle, with fan pressure mounting on the club to secure Salah's future as his contract nears its summer expiry. Slot told Amazon Prime: ""Every time we need Mo Salah he scores a goal. ""We are hoping and expecting he can continue this for a long time. He was outstanding in the second half, he did many special things for us."" Salah, 32, has been involved in 13 goals across his last seven Premier League games (nine goals, four assists). He now sits fifth in the club's all-time list of top scorers, just two goals behind Billy Liddell in fourth. Speaking to BBC Match of the Day, Slot said:""He is irreplaceable because every time he plays 90 minutes. So that probably tells you everything. And we all see how important he is with his goals and his assists. The special thing about him is he doesn't even have to play a very good first hour to be so special in the last half hour."""
3/17/2025,08:30,Was there a 'weakness' at the back?,"FormerChelseawinger Pat Nevin says ""it is encouragement for every other team"" in the Premier League that Newcastle were able to score three against Liverpool. Arne Slot's side have had the best defence in the league this season, in terms of goals conceded, but looked more vulnerable at St James' Park. ""Liverpool's defence in the first half didn't actually look that good,"" said Nevin on the BBC Radio 5 Live Football Daily podcast. ""It was unbalanced and it didn't look as well structured. ""If Trent Alexander-Arnold can't play at right-back then they would normally have Conor Bradley there, but he's not available either. Teams will look at that side and see a weakness. ""Newcastle noticeably went long a lot because they had spotted there was not a lot of pace in Liverpool's back line. We hadn't spotted that weakness before but going over the top and getting in behind is something other teams might now look at doing. ""But having said, that soon stopped as soon as Alexander-Arnold came on!"" Listen to the full discussion on BBC Sounds"

""Tired players create space and when you get space on a football field, it is good players that make capital. That was a display from very, very good players. ""Alexander Isak was phenomenal. Every time he got the ball in the first half he was making chances and was unstoppable when he was dribbling. ""In the second-half it was like Mohamed Salah responded and said 'I can do that too' and he started to do the same. ""It was a classic game that you didn't want to end. It was great fun to watch.

The ebb and flow meant it was hard to take your eyes off of it as Liverpool twice battled back to level, led at one stage before having to settle for a draw. It was a game that was played at a high tempo throughout and gave reasons for encouragement for both sets of fans. For Liverpool supporters, while not coming away with three points will have been disappointing, the fighting spirit shown by their side should be considered encouraging because that will be needed on plenty of occasions in this title battle. The draw means Liverpool's advantage at the top is cut to seven points but with plenty of games to be played in December there's going to be twists and turns to come."

I knew the game could be changed around, we were much better with the ball. ""After the week we had, we could change the game which is a very positive thing to take.

3/17/2025,15:39,'Contract troubles not spooking the fans is telling',"Liverpool look like a juggernaut that no-one seems capable of stopping. Even the contractual uncertainty over the beloved and still utterly brilliant Mo Salah, the imperious Virgil van Dijk and classy Trent Alexander-Arnold isn't spooking the fans in any discernible way. That really is saying something. The Kopites must think that if they can lose Jurgen Klopp and still stay on an upward trajectory, then they probably ought to trust the process whoever is on the pitch. For his part, if Arne Slot keeps this momentum going, they will be mentioning him alongside Bill Shankly, Kenny Dalglish and Klopp soon enough. Over the space of 90 minutes againstManchester City, Liverpool became undisputed favourites to take the title. They still are not certainties by any calculation, even with a nine-point lead over their current nearest challengersChelseaandArsenal- but they have the edge.

3/17/2025,13:16,Can Liverpool tame 'ferocious and formidable'  St James' Park?,"Another day, another high-profile fixture for Liverpool - who continue to take almost all before them. Within four days at Anfield last week they brushed aside the European champions and Premier League champions with a swagger and poise that meant the 2-0 scorelines vastly underplayed the Reds' advantage. Arne Slot's achievements so far have been widely applauded and it is easy to see why. Much has been made of the more measured and controlled approach favoured by the new boss compared with Jurgen Klopp, but one of the many admirable aspects of the victories over Real Madrid andManchester Citywas the fast and furious way they set about their opponents. In both matches their dominance could easily have led to a three or four-goal lead by half-time. There was an intensity to their play in the first period of both games that was matched by the intelligent way they approached the remaining time. Confidence and self-belief is now running through the very core of the team, whatever the starting line-up. Slot has managed the squad impressively. Curtis Jones, in the form of his life, was surprisingly left out of the side for the City game. Yet his replacement, Dominik Szoboszlai, gave his best performance of the season so far. The injuries to Ibrahima Konate and Conor Bradley could hardly have come at a worse time, but the depth and quality in the squad means they look capable of coping - or at least so far. Newcastle at St James' Park represents another significant challenge, though. Despite a mostly underwhelming opening third to the season so far, Eddie Howe's team do have the capacity to cause problems for even the most resolute of defences. The stadium can be a ferocious and formidable venue, particularly for night matches. It also promises to give us another insight into just how well equipped Liverpool are to becoming a very real deal.

3/17/2025,12:57,Will Isak play?,"Newcastle striker Alexander Isak appears to have ruled himself in for Wednesday's Premier League game against leaders Liverpool. In his pre-match news conference on Tuesday, Magpies boss Eddie Howe stated that Isak had not been in training following the hip injury he picked up against Crystal Palace that forced him to be withdrawn. While Howe did not expect it to be a long-term problem, he said it would be about ""time and pain management"" for the forward. But speaking to Bein Sports, Isak said: ""It was a knock to my hip and it was too painful to carry on - but it's developed pretty good so, I feel good and hopefully 100%."" When asked whether he is fit to face Liverpool at St James' Park, he replied: ""That's the plan."" Isak has four goals and two assists in 11 appearances this season in the Premier League."

This is still a tough game for Liverpool, though, off the back of such a big week for them with wins over Real Madrid andManchester City. The Magpies have already beatenArsenalat St James' Park this season and they are certainly capable of getting something against Liverpool too, but you just cannot back against the leaders at the moment. Arne Slot has such great strength in depth right through his squad and they can win games in different ways. Even if they do drop points here, their bubble is not going to burst any time soon.

Conway, 22, scored either side of half-time in the3-1 win over Hull Citythanks to two assists from Doak, who he also plays with for the Scotland national team. ""I love him, not only on the pitch does he cause carnage and creates but off the pitch as well, he's a good mate of mine,"" Conway told BBC Radio Tees. ""When we're away with Scotland, we're always chilling out together. ""He said he's going to send me the invoice and I did say 'look Beno, I had to do a little bit for you'.

Since Conway made hissummer moveto the Riverside from Bristol City, he has notched eight goals in his first 14 league appearances. However, the striker claims he doesn't care who provides the goals as long as the team continue to climb the league table - where they currently sit fifth.

The forward has made 20 appearances so far this season, scoring 13 goals and assisting 11. ""I am not worried his numbers will drop off but more about an injury,"" said Slot. ""Federico Chiesa has had a difficult start because of injuries, so we don't really have a replacement for Mo. ""But Harvey Elliott is getting fitter and fitter and has played this position before. The best thing that can happen to us is Mo stays fit and keeps producing these numbers."""

Despite the Reds sitting nine points clear ofArsenalandChelseain the Premier League, Slot says his squad have their ""feet on the ground"" in terms of not getting ahead of themselves. ""It is important,"" said Slot on their positioning in the league and Europe. ""But it is also the culture of this club. ""For us, it’s not a dead-special thing to be top of the league and Champions League. This team and players are used to competing for every trophy. It helps that they have experienced this. ""It also helps that they have competed and then come up short. They know it’s a long season and to win the league against Chelsea, Arsenal andManchester City- because they are who I see as a our main competitors - means they will have to be on top of their game for nine or 10 months. ""If you are down for just one second then those clubs show up."""
3/17/2025,09:58,"Slot on team news, defensive 'worries' and keeping grounded","Liverpool boss Arne Slot has been speaking to the media before Wednesday's Premier League game atNewcastle United(kick-off 19:30 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Trent Alexander-Arnold is unlikely to play a full match against Newcastle orEvertonas Slot continues to manage his minutes following his injury. Goalkeeper Alisson is ""getting closer and closer"" to a return and is expected to ""be back in goal"" by the end of the month, while forward Federico Chiesa has returned to training with the squad. He added that Caoimhin Kelleher ""is doing too well to put Alisson in goal"" as he works towards ""complete"" fitness. On being nine points clear at the top of the league: ""We don't get too carried away. We have a difficult week coming up again. It's even harder to go away to Newcastle and we're not even halfway through the season yet. But it is a good position to be in."" He said ""it is a bit of a worry"" having three defenders sidelined through injury when they play nine times in a month, but they ""will make creative decisions"" to balance the team in that period and to keep players fit. On having the best defence in terms of goals conceded: ""It doesn't mean we only have the best defence, it means we have 11 players who work really hard to not concede goals. Every time they have to defend they are there."" He said being top of the league and Champions League table ""is important for the culture of the club"" but it is a situation many of his players are used to. Slot added: ""Every team we've faced, we've had to work really hard to get a result. That keeps them with both feet on the ground."" In response to whether they are concerned that they are over-reliant on Mohamed Salah: ""A bit, but only for the fact that he is also a human being and he can also get an injury like he did last season. We don't really have a replacement for Mo. I am not afraid that his numbers will drop but the best thing for us is to keep him fit."" On opponents Newcastle: ""They are a team that have won at home toChelseaandArsenaland drawn againstManchester City. The players don't need me to tell them how difficult the game will be."" On the possibility of strengthening the squad in January's transfer window: ""I am so, so happy with the squad. That is not to say that if there is a chance then the club won't go for it because they have always shown they will.""

3/17/2025,15:59,'If Salah is offered another year I think he should just take it',"Former Liverpool midfielder Bolo Zenden says offering Mohamed Salah a short-term deal could be the compromise needed to keep him at the club beyond this season. Salah has been in fine form, scoring and assisting again in Sunday's win overManchester City, but his deal expires at the end of the campaign and he has recently said he is currently ""more out than in"" when it comes to his Anfield future. ""Everybody would like to have Mo Salah in their team,"" Zenden told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""The way he performs, what he brings to the team, what he brings to the fans - you would think they would give him a contract to stay. In a financial sense, I'm sure Salah would be looking for a long-term contract and I don't think Liverpool would offer that. ""If he is offered another year I think he should just take it and then he can take it from year to year. ""We've seen it at Real Madrid.

3/17/2025,15:58,Are the Reds trio playing 'a game' and proving their worth?,"Former Premier League defender Sebastian Bassong says ""there is a bit of game"" being played by Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold as their future at Liverpool remains unclear. The trio, whose contracts expire next summer, are making the headlines for the right reasons, according to Bassong - because their strong performances warrant a contract extension or a big move after Anfield. ""When you look at those three players, there is no coincidence between the fact that they're out of contract and their level of performances,"" said Bassong onBBC World Service's Sportsworld. ""Obviously, there's a new manager coming in, but even unconsciously, when you know you are out of contract, it about trying to sign a new contract or to get a better new contract elsewhere. ""When you're a top player, that is when your level of performance is going to just rise straight back up. ""So right now, I think there's a bit of a game. Football is a business at the end of the day. They want to get a pay rise. They want to show their capabilities and the best way for them to that is to perform."""
3/17/2025,15:56,'They are getting better and better',"Liverpool fans should be able to get ""carried away"" after the team's impressive win overManchester Cityon Sunday, says BBC Radio Merseyside summariser Craig Hignett. Despite just the two goals, the Reds had a comfortable afternoon against the defending champions at Anfield and could have won by a bigger margin than their 2-0 victory. Arne Slot's side now sit nine points clear ofArsenalin second place and 11 points clear of Manchester City. No team has ever had that margin of a lead after this many games in a Premier League season and not gone on to win the trophy. ""They are a mile ahead of City now if you look at that [game], a mile ahead,"" said Hignett. ""They have got a bit of breathing space. This win is massive. Everyone is talking about Liverpool now and how good they are - this was a test. ""Even though City hadn't won in six, this was still a real test. So for them to pass it the way they have, teams will be looking at Liverpool and thinking, ‘hang on a minute, we thought City were good but this team'. ""I don't think it [the Liverpool team] is at it's best, there is still more to come from it and it is improving. You can feel that as the season is going on, they are getting better and better. ""It is brilliant for Liverpool fans and it's hard not to get carried away – I want to get carried away with seeing that. For me, I think Liverpool have put paid to Manchester City's title hopes here without a shadow of a doubt."" Listen to the full discussion on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,15:55,"'In every aspect, they are what you would want your team to be'","The problem for all the teams chasing Liverpool is that I don't see the Premier League leaders as having any real weakness at the moment. Arne Slot's side probably putManchester Cityout of the title race by beating them at Anfield on Sunday, to leave them 11 points adrift. Even before this week, Liverpool had made an unbelievable start to the season but in the past few days they have played Real Madrid and Manchester City, who have dominated Europe for a long time now, and beaten them both convincingly. Against City, they were much better in every position. Their midfield overpowered City's and the 2-0 scoreline did not do their performance justice. Liverpool were defensively solid and well organised too. They had injuries to contend with at the back - Ibrahima Konate and Conor Bradley were both absent after getting injured against Real, but it did not seem to matter. It is the same right through the team. They have been without Alisson, who is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, since the end of October but no-one ever mentions he is missing, because of the form of Caoimhin Kelleher. That depth of quality means Slot has options and the ability to rotate his players, particularly in midfield. Liverpool are mean at the back and a tight unit that defends together, but they still create lots of chances, and are strong from set-pieces too. In every aspect, they are what you would want your team to be. Read Shearer's full column here"
3/17/2025,11:53,'It would be smart to buy in January',"It was a massive call by Arne Slot to drop the superbly performing Curtis Jones againstManchester City, but Dom Szoboszlai proved his manager right. The Hungarian was exceptional. He covered every blade of grass, pressed and harried relentlessly off the ball and carried it smartly when he had it. Liverpool's midfield was supposedly the area of the squad that needed improving, but it is stronger than anyone realised at the start of the season. Not a Liverpool fan? Find your Premier League club's page here Harvey Elliott also came off the bench to provide us another option in the attacking midfield role, with Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister playing beautifully in the deeper-lying positions. Liverpool are nine points clear at the top of the Premier League table, but it would be smart to buy in January and consolidate from a position of strength. A new number six to allow Gravenberch to be rested or rotated would be handy, as Slot clearly does not trust Wataru Endo or Tyler Morton enough to use them in the big competitions. We could probably do with another defender, too, given the various injuries that are plaguing a growing number of players. Hopefully the Reds will go back in for Martin Zubimendi, as his traits would suit Slot's midfield perfectly. Find more from Jordan Chamberlain atEmpire of the Kop, external"
3/17/2025,11:52,'Anfield thrives on winding up managers',"Arne Slot's marrying of high-intensity football and a more measured and controlled approach has been key in his fine start in succeeding Jurgen Klopp, says Liverpool fan Josh Sexton. Sunday's comfortable 2-0 win over championsManchester Citysent the Reds nine points clear at the top of the Premier League. ""The first half performance from Liverpool especially was sublime,"" Sexton told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. ""We're a team that looks supremely confident right now and it is oozing out of us and out of Anfield and the fans right now. ""Slot has been really good at striking the balance between Klopp-style football and a more measured and controlled aspect. He mentioned in the summer that he wants to balance risk and reward more. ""In the moments Manchester City were getting more of a foothold, Liverpool were prepared to suffer, prepared to be a little bit more patient and it paid off in the end - and we were able to capitalise on our big moments going forward."" In response to goading from Liverpool fans, Pep Guardiola held up six fingers to indicate the six Premier League titles he has won since arriving in England. ""Anfield thrives on winding up managers and I think there was an element of it getting under Pep Guardiola's skin,"" Sexton added. ""He's ultimately watching his team fall apart in front of his eyes and watching a Liverpool team move so many points clear at the top of the league. That's what football is about - when things are going well you have to capitalise on that banter."" Listen to the full chat from 06:25 on BBC Sounds"
3/17/2025,11:51,'A cocktail of old Klopp and new Slot',"The trademark of Arne Slot's Liverpool has been a more measured, composed strategy when set against the wilder elements of Jurgen Klopp's emotion-charged approach. This was an unstoppable combination of the two that Pep Guardiola'sManchester Citysimply could not handle. December may have only just been ushered in. The Premier League season may only be 13 games old. Even so, it seems impossible to imagine anyone overhauling Liverpool in this mood. Speaking afterwards, even Slot conceded his side were ""close"" to perfection. ""At the end the result is the most important, but the performance was great,"" he told BBC Match of the Day. ""If you want to win against a team like City you have to be good at every part of football. So high defending, low defending, build-up, high, low - everything. They bring so many challenges to you."" The numbers certainly suggested Liverpool went for the more direct, pressurised approach, with 14.8% of their passes going long, compared to their season average of 9.1% before this game. This was certainly a slight departure, a cocktail of old Klopp and new Slot. Liverpool's successful transition from Klopp to Slot carried a qualification early on. Namely, that it was all well and good, but who of consequence had they played? Anfield has always been the most unforgiving place for Guardiola and so it proved once more, with City now remarkably not even in the Premier League's top four. In contrast, life could not be better for Slot, with a remarkable record of 18 wins from his first 20 games. Defender Joe Gomez, in for injured Ibrahima Konate, was full of praise for Slot - and Klopp - as he told Match of the Day: ""The biggest thing is that he is not trying to fill Jurgen's shoes or be Jurgen. ""Jurgen’s legacy is stamped in the history of this club and cannot be changed. He [Slot] has been himself. It has been refreshing and all the coaching staff have been positive.""

3/17/2025,09:05,Liverpool 2-0 Man City - the fans' verdict,"Monday's Guardian Sport and iSport's back pages We asked for your thoughts after Sunday's Premier League game between Liverpool andManchester City. Here are some of your comments: Krish:Credit to Arne Slot. He has made Liverpool calm, controlled and confident. Taken all the chaos out of our play. The real test though will come when we have a bad patch - but hopefully not until the league is won! A joy to watch this team at the moment. KP:Great game which could have been out of reach earlier with better finishing by all. You can't rule City out and the error by Virgil van Dijk would have gone in on another day, with pressure at the end. Great timing of subs from Slot, which is a nice change this season. Less emotion = better decisions. Tracy:Electric, confident performance at Anfield with a great result for the team and the devoted Red fans. Continuing to lead the Premier League under Arne Slot, but Liverpool must not take their foot off the pressure as every game will count going forward. Not a Liverpool fan? Find your club's page here Philo:Brilliant, incisive attacking play backed up by intelligent and resolute defending throughout. Exactly what champions are made of. For all the fuss about missing Ibrahima Konate, Joe Gomez came in and was immense. Stuart:Liverpool harassed and terrorised City from the first whistle, then soaked up the second-half pressure like a sponge. Van Dijk was colossal in defence. Gomez stepped in for Konate with ease. The stadium atmosphere was incredible. It could have been four or five nil! Richard:It's beginning to look a Slot like Christmas... everywhere we go. Magnificent team performance. Not as strong asagainst Real Madrid on Wednesday,but close. What the lads and Arne are doing is just magnificent. We don't always turn it on every single match, but we just seem to grind it out, no matter what. The Premier League is now ours to lose."

""Liverpool started fantastic,"" Brown told BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. ""Players were dropping in to play with great intensity, the midfielders were making great runs and trying to get shots away and the defensive pairing were winning duels. ""They then waited and defended as City grew back into the game, and they did that really well as a team. ""I really like the way they press and are hungry out of possession.

""Common sense says it is their Premier League title to lose,"" said Reo-Coker on BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast. ""That is the reality of it, but Arne Slot is being very acute and smart in interviews to not say it. ""When the season started, Liverpool were not even in the conversation of the title race. It was all talk ofManchester CityandArsenal. No-one knew what to expect from Liverpool, but Slot has gone in there and it is hard to see a better well-drilled team in the league. ""They are so well-tuned in every aspect of their game and there is no weak link in the team because everyone is playing to such a high level.

""I understand what it means to be ready and to stay consistent throughout the season, as it can change so quickly. I have enjoyed it and I have to keep on working."" On whether there were any nerves during the game:""I would be lying if there wasn't. When we missed a few big chances and it was 1-0, it can change so quickly.

The amount of chances we missed made it tight at the end, but maybe that's nice for matches like this. It should be like this. ""But it would have been nicer to score the second goal earlier. We always press high but they are so good at build up, so you have to work very hard. Our players had energy. Apart from our players, the crowd was fantastic today as well. ""They always make it difficult for you in the way they position [themselves]. It's not only formation, nine out of 10 times it is the quality of their players. We have some quality players on the pitch too. ""We are a compatible team and it is difficult to beat us, but also we have to put the effort in. ""But we have injuries, we had to take Trent [Alexander-Arnold] off. It would have been a risk. These are the challenges we face at the moment, but every team has to face these challenges over a season. ""Next week is another big week against Newcastle and Everton. ""Ideally I would have loved to have seen the second-half being the same as the first-half, but it was the quality of the other team. ""If you want to win against City, you have to be perfect in every part of the game. High press, low press, build up. They bring so many problems to you. We came close to perfection. We weren't perfect, but we came close to perfection. That's the only way to beat a quality team like City. ""I don't think anyone, including me, would have predicted this [start]. I knew Jurgen [Klopp] left the team in a very good place. But, still, to win so much with all the difficult teams we have played already is not something you could predict at the start of the season. ""But, like I say, I saw Arsenal yesterday and Chelsea today and I saw City. They will come back because these teams have so much quality.

3/17/2025,11:18,Sutton's predictions: Liverpool v Man City,"Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against a variety of guests. For week 13, he takes on boxer Sunny Edwards who is a Chelsea fan. Sutton's prediction: 4-1 I was at Anfield on Wednesday for BBC Radio 5 Live. Liverpool had a brilliant night, beating Real Madrid in the manner which they did, but there was a bit of bad news for their manager Arne Slot before the end. Conor Bradley was sensational but he came off late on with what looked like a hamstring injury and then, in stoppage time, Ibrahima Konate fell awkwardly too. Ideally I would wait to see if those two are fit before deciding what will happen here, but I am so far ahead of everyone else with my predictions that it's probably fairer I make a call now. From Manchester City's point of view, Erling Haaland didn't have his shooting boots on against Tottenham last weekend, but he did have some chances. The worrying thing was what happened when he didn't take them, because City capitulated. Pep Guardiola is stressed and the players look edgy and short of confidence, but let's put it into context because this is one bad month after many years of total dominance. What Pep has achieved and done for the Premier League has been phenomenal. You look through their team and it makes me want to stick to my mantra from the past few weeks, which is that City will respond and remind us how good they are. While Trent Alexander-Arnold could come back in for Bradley, it is the injury to Konate that gives City a glimmer of hope, because he and Virgil van Dijk have formed such a good partnership under Arne Slot. I still think the intensity Liverpool played with against Real Madrid will be too much for City, and I'm expecting Slot's side to repeat that. Their midfield looks so strong and Curtis Jones really impressed me against Real. It has been a good week for Liverpool and a good season so far, but a win to send them 11 points clear of the defending champions would make it a great week and a great campaign - and that's what I'm going for. They might not just beat City, they might take them apart like Tottenham did. Sunny's prediction: 2-2 For a long time it just seemed unfair how good Manchester City were, but not anymore. They need a big performance here. Liverpool seem to be grinding out the results but I actually think this game might be quite even. Read the full predictions and have your say here"

3/17/2025,15:40,The stats behind Liverpool's success and Man City's struggles,"Liverpool and Manchester City go into Sunday's Premier League fixture at Anfield with the Reds eight points clear at the top of the table and City on a six-match winless run in all competitions. We have taken a look atsome of the statisticsbehind their contrasting fortunes... It is not the volume of chances that is the main issue for Manchester City defensively, but the quality of them. City concede by far the highest quality of chance in Europe's top five leagues. Only two teams are giving up fewer chances than City's eight per game on average - German Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich and Getafe, who are 15th in Spain's La Liga. Meanwhile, Liverpool have four more points compared to their first 12 games of last season. The level of their play has not changed dramatically - it is just a bit more defensive-minded. They have faced 37 fewer shots, but taken 35 fewer."

3/17/2025,19:39,Konate ruled out with 'frustrating' injury,"Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate says he will now ""start the recovery process"" after picking up a ""frustrating"" injury against Real Madrid. The 25-year-old's absence is a blow for Reds boss Arne Slot with his side hosting title rivalsManchester Cityon Sunday. There has been no clarification from the club on the timescale Konate could be missing for but on Friday the centre-back expressed his disappointment on social media. ""So frustrating to pick up this injury right at the end of a great game on Wednesday night,"" hesaid on Instagram, external. ""Now we start the recovery process but one thing I promise is I will come back and be the best I can be once again. Thank you for the amazing support at Anfield.

3/17/2025,19:25,How Guardiola must embrace chaos to attack Liverpool,"Manchester City travel to Liverpool on Sunday with the usual narrative flipped on its head. This time it is the reigning champions who must find a way through the league's best defence. But there is a route to victory for Guardiola, providing he embraces the end-to-end wildness into which this fixture so often descends. Six of the eight Premier League goals Liverpool have conceded this season were scored in transition - just after the ball has been turned over. Five of those eight goals were created by running directly at, or past, the Reds' full-backs. That should be City's target. Guardiola should field his fastest ball-carrying wingers and encourage quick distribution into their feet when possession turns over. Jeremy Doku and Savinho, if hit early, can cause damage running at Liverpool's right-back (whomever it is) and left-back Andrew Robertson - undone already this season by Callum Hudson-Odoi, Kaoru Mitoma, Tyler Dibling and Bukayo Saka. There is an even better way to expose this vulnerability; slot Kevin de Bruyne into the right-half space, the column of the pitch that runs between opposition left-back and centre-back. As he comes back to fitness, De Bruyne is just the kind of player needed to take advantage of space behind Liverpool's left winger, which is precisely what he did the last time Man City beat the Reds. De Bruyne (17) playing close to Mahrez (26) on City's right, attacking Liverpool's left side in a 4-1 win in April 2023 In the above graphic from the4-1 victoryin April 2023, City's number 17 De Bruyne lurked out right and combined with Riyad Mahrez to punishing effect. His pass map below also illustrates a greater concentration of contributions from that side of the pitch. Green passes are successful and red are unsuccessful Better still for City, Liverpool have conceded three goals from through balls played in behind by a central midfielder. Something De Bruyne could do for Erling Haaland. There is a path to a City win, but only if Guardiola breaks tradition and goes all-in on a transitional game, something Liverpool head coach Arne Slot has begun to pull back on from predecessor Jurgen Klopp's all-action style."
3/17/2025,16:47,The 'one-off' of Salah and Mbappe penalty misses,"On the latest episode of The Commentators' View podcast, BBC Radio 5 Live commentators Alistair Bruce-Ball, John Murray and Ian Dennis reflected on Liverpool's Champions League win over Real Madrid on Wednesday. ""We've done this job for a long time and yet how often is it that something happens and you think: 'I've never seen that before, that's a one-off,"" said Murray. ""That was exactly it, with Kylian Mbappe and Mohamed Salah having penalties within a few minutes of one another and neither of them scoring."" Liverpool goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, currently deputising for the injured Alisson, kept out Mbappe's spot-kick in the second half. Murray added: ""He's really stepped up. I remember Jurgen Klopp saying, when he was still relatively untried, that Kelleher was one of the best number-two goalkeepers around. ""Alisson is a little injury-prone, so Kelleher has now played more than 50 times for Liverpool. Now they're in a position where they've got Alisson, Kelleher doing what he's doing and also Giorgi Mamardashvili, who was one of their only summer signings and one assumes will be coming back to Liverpool from Valencia at the end of the season. ""There's a big decision for several parties coming not too far down the road on this."" For more tales from the commentary box, listen to the full podcast on BBC Sounds"

3/17/2025,12:58,'Consistency' separates teams in the title race,"The question of who is in the title race right now is a good one, but I still think it is Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal. At the beginning of the season, I said Liverpool would be up there because I feel people forgot how well they actually did last season. They are favourites at the moment because of the consistency they have shown this year, but we all know that the likes of City and the Gunners are capable of going on long winning runs. City are in unknown territory at the moment with the form they are in, but they are still a group of Premier League and Champions League winners who know how to win and bounce back. However, if Liverpool get the win at Anfield this weekend, that would make them clearer favourites. The reason I have not put Chelsea and Brighton alongside the other three teams as title contenders is because of the consistency of these teams over the past few years. Those three have been up there challenging the past two or three seasons and I think that puts them ahead. We have seen Chelsea are developing in terms of their age and have not been as consistent with their results. The same with Brighton. They put in some really good performances - but then some not so good. With the heavy December schedule and into January, that is when we will start to see a split and those teams with a better squad depth start to break away a bit. And yet, although that is what we are used to seeing, when you look at the league this year it has been one of the most up and down starts ever to a campaign in terms of consistency. Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Nicola Pearson"
3/17/2025,10:53,'Man City will think they've got to get a result' - Rush,"Liverpool's all-time leading goalscorer Ian Rush has been speaking to BBC Radio Merseyside about Sunday's Premier League game between the Reds andManchester Cityat Anfield. A Liverpool win would take Arne Slot's side 11 points clear of Pep Guardiola's reigning champions. ""We're in a position where maybe if you don't lose to City, it's not a bad result,"" said former Wales striker Rush. ""Normally we're having to beat Manchester City to stay in the title race, but City will be thinking they've got to get a result against Liverpool - and it's at Liverpool as well. The atmosphere is going to be incredible. The fans will get behind the team and hopefully the players will react."" However, with about two-thirds of the Premier League season still to be played, Rush believes there is still plenty of time for City - who have failed to win any of their past six games - to claw their way back into title contention. ""Manchester City always come good in January when needed,"" he added. ""When I was playing at Liverpool, they said that was the real start of the season. You hang in there until January and then you kick on. ""When I played, Liverpool used to do that and Manchester City have been doing that in the past few years. Liverpool have to be in a position where they can do the same as them from January."" Listen to the full interview on BBC Sounds"
