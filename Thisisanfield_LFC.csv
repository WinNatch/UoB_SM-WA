Frimpong has long been considered one of the best young right-backs in Europe – and the 24-year-old has cemented that status in a successful stint at Leverkusen.
Part of Xabi Alonso’s unbeaten Bundesliga winners last season, the Dutchman has continued his strong form this time out with four goals and 11 assists in 40 appearances so far.

Sinclair’s post-Liverpool career has failed to live up to the promise of his record-breaking debut, but he has looked to make the most of his opportunities outside of football.

Bradley has already missed the last six games for Liverpool with a hamstring injury, and the issue has forced him to sit out Northern Ireland’s friendlies with Switzerland and Sweden this month.

Chiesa scored his second goal for Liverpool in the closing stages of Sunday’s 2-1 defeat to Newcastle at Wembley, amplifying calls for more game time.

Isak was a scourge at Wembley on Sunday, scoring Newcastle‘s second goal in their eventual 2-1 victory over the Reds.

Chiesa scored what was a consolation goal in the defeat to Newcastle, but in doing so highlighted the mystery that surrounds his lack of game time under Slot this season.

Elliott made a positive impact off the bench as Liverpool pushed for an unlikely comeback at Wembley, assisting Federico Chiesa for the goal that made it 2-1.

Salah was among Liverpool’s least effective performers in an awful showing at Wembley, finding himself marked out of the game by makeshift left-back Tino Livramento.

It was a mismatch which led to Newcastle‘s first goal, the towering Burn given a free header from the edge of the box which sailed in for 1-0.
Mac Allister was hapless to stop his marker and, despite how effective it proved for Eddie Howe’s side, Liverpool did not change their approach in defending set-pieces afterwards.

Slot made three changes for the visit of Southampton but was forced to make three more at half-time as his side went in 1-0 down.

Endo was challenging for loose ball in the middle of the park when, moving to head it, the Japan captain was met with the full force of Ipswich substitute Enciso.
Enciso, who had been on the pitch for mere minutes, leapt off the ground and collided directly with Endo’s stomach and, more concerningly, his face.

The Reds were expected to win and did so heavily, with Dominik Szoboszlai‘s long-ranger, Mohamed Salah‘s 100th league goal at Anfield and Cody Gakpo‘s brace earning the three points.

Szoboszlai has, partly due to comments from Slot himself, come under the microscope this season for his involvement in front of goal.

Arne Slot‘s side eased to one of their most comfortable wins of the season on Saturday, retaining their stranglehold in the race for the Premier League title.

Ipswich forward Julio Enciso had only been on the pitch for a minute when he produced a nasty challenge on Endo, his studs finding the midfielder’s stomach and his knee colliding with his face.

The Reds got the job done in midweek to guarantee their place in the Champions League last 16, with a first or second-place finish in the league phase to be finalised on Wednesday.

In the summer of 2023, Misciur made the move from Hull to Liverpool and joined up with Marc Bridge-Wilkinson’s under-18s, for whom he made 25 appearances.

“I didn’t see them fight for it in the first half – we lost almost every long ball, every duel to both sides,” pretty damning words from the head coach, right?
Well if we look at the numbers with the help of FotMob, we can see the Reds lost the duel battle in the opening half 31 to 22 – the Reds winning just 36 percent of t"

The Reds’ first 45 minutes at Portman Road saw them head into the dressing room with zero shots on target and having won only 36 percent of their ground duels.
Ipswich were more physical and it left Slot to say that the “first half was not good enough, [the] second half was a real good performance.”

The 21-year-old was named in the starting XI at Portman Road, selected ahead of Ibrahima Konate after a strong pre-season.
But Quansah did not emerge after the half-time break, with Konate taking his place next to Virgil van Dijk instead – an odd first substitute on the face of it.

Heading into the campaign without a recognised No. 6 suitable for Arne Slot‘s system has been far from ideal, but the head coach was quick to settle the debate over who would take on the role.

Gomez was a valuable utility man under Jurgen Klopp, utilised across the defence with great effect last season – arguably one of his best in a red shirt.
